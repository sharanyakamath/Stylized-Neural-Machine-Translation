I’m sorry you’ll leave my father like that.
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil, robbed it of some tediousness.
And Launcelot, you’ll see Lorenzo soon at supper.
Give him this letter.
Goodbye!
If a Christian doesn’t play the knave and get you, I’m very wrong.
But goodbye.
These foolish drops drown my manly spirit.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, good Launcelot.
Oh, what a heinous sin I’m having to be ashamed of being my father’s child!
But even though I’m a daughter to his blood, I’m not to his manners.
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise, I’ll end this fight, become a Christian and your loving wife.
