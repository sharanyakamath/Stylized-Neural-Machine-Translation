Who's there?
No, answer me.
Halt, and identify yourself.
Long live the king!
Bernardo?
Yes.
You’re really on time.
It’s just midnight.
Go to bed, Francisco.
Thanks for being on time.
It’s bitter cold, And I’m depressed.
Have things been quiet on your watch?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
If you meet Horatio and Marcellus, The ones who will watch with me, tell them to hurry up.
I think I hear them.
Halt!
Who goes there?
Your friends.
And subjects of the Dane.
Have a good night.
Bernardo.
Have a good-night.
What, is that Horatio with you?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, good Marcellus.
Tell me, has this thing appeared again tonight?
I haven’t seen anything.
Horatio says it’s all in our imagination, And doesn’t believe a word we say About this dreaded sight, seen twice by us.
So I’ve begged him to come along With us to watch what happens this night, That, if this apparition comes again, He may believe what we have seen and speak to it.
Nonsense, nonsense, it will not appear.
Sit down awhile, And let us tell you once again, You who is so stubborn in not believing our story, What we have seen these last two nights.
OK, let’s sit down, And listen to Bernardo speak of this.
Last night, When that star up there, that's west of the North Pole, Had moved around to light that part of the sky Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The clock’s bell then tolling one, Quiet, stop!
Look it’s coming again!
It looks just like the dead king!
You’re a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.
Doesn’t it look like the King?
Look at it, Horatio.
Yes, it does.
It fills me with fear and wonder.
It wants to be spoken to.
Question it, Horatio.
What are you, that seizes this time of night, Taking the same fair and warlike form In which the dead king of Denmark, now buried, Did sometimes march?
By heaven I order you, speak!
It is offended.
See, it stalks away!
Stay!
speak, speak!
I order you to speak!
It is gone, and will not answer us.
What’s wrong, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.
Is this not more than our imaginations?
What do you think about it?
Before my God, I might not believe this thing Without the seeing and true testimony Of my own eyes.
Isn’t it like the King?
As you are to yourself.
It is strange.
It’s come twice before, and just appearing out of nothing, he’s gone past us at this dead hour with a warlike stalk.
I don’t know what its intentions are, But, in the plainness and freedom of my opinion, This foretells some strange eruption to our state.
Who is the man who can explain this to me?
I can explain it, At least, what’s on the grapevine.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
Well it may turn out that this warning figure Comes armed through our watch, looking so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.
It is a speck of dust to irritate the mind's eye.
In the most high and palm tree-like state of Rome, A little before the mightiest Julius Caesar was killed, The graves had no bodies, and the dead in sheets Squeaked and gibbered in the Roman streets, And stars with trains of fire and red morning dews, Disasters in the sun.
And like similar forecasters of fierce events, As the advance team before the fates, And prologue to the omen coming on, Heaven and earth have together demonstrated To our country and countrymen.
Look where it comes again!
I’ll cross it, though it kill me.
Stay, illusion!
stay, and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus!
Shall I strike at it with my club?
Go ahead, if it will not stand.
It is here!
It is here!
It is gone!
We do it wrong, its being so like the king, To offer it the show of violence, Because it is, like the air, unable to be hurt, And our empty blows seem like a malicious joke.
It was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.
And then it seemed startled, like a guilty thing Running from a court order.
I have heard The rooster, that is the trumpet of the morning, With his lofty and shrill-sounding throat, Awakes the god of day, and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The straying and wandering spirit hurries back To his grave.
It faded on the crowing of the rooster.
I’ve heard that too, and partly believe it.
But, look, the morning, dressed in a red cape, Walks over the dew of that high hill in the east.
Let’s break up our watch, and I think We should tell all we have seen tonight To young Hamlet, for, I swear on my life, This spirit, silent to us, will speak to him.
Do you agree that we shall tell him, Because we love him and it is our duty?
Let's do it, I beg you, and I know exactly Where we shall easily find him. 
We have not disregarded Your good advice, which has freely gone Along with this affair.
To all, our thanks.
I will tell you now, as you know, young Fortinbras, Not thinking very much of us, Or thinking that our late dear brother's death Made our country disorganized and no longer powerful, Conspiring with this dream of his advantage, Has not failed to pester us with messages, Asking us to the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, within all the rules of law, To our most valiant brother.
So much for him!
Now what we have done so far Is this.
we have here written To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, knows nothing Of his nephew's intentions, to stop His further progress in this plan because the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Without his knowledge, and we are sending You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, To take this greeting to old Norway, Without giving you any further personal power To do business with the king, more than the scope Of these detailed items allow.
Farewell and hurry to do your duty.
In that and all things, we will show our duty.
We do not doubt it.
Heartily, farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us you want something.
What is it, Laertes?
You cannot start to ask the King of Denmark, And then stop.
What do you want, Laertes, That I shall not my offer before you ask?
The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to your father.
What would you ask, Laertes?
Have you your father's permission?
What says Polonius?
My lord, he has wrung from me my reluctant permission By asking me again and again, and I Finally had to give in.
I do beg you, give him permission to go.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
That’s not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.
Good Hamlet, take off your black looks, And let your eye look on the King like a friend.
Don’t look for your noble father on the ground Forever with sad eyes.
Yes, madam, that’s the way it goes.
If that’s the way it goes, Why does it seem unusual with you?
Seem?”, madam!
No, it is.
For shame!
It is a sin to heaven, A sin against the dead, a sin to nature, Most ridiculous to reason, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still has cried, From the first corpse to the man who died just today, ”This must be so.” We beg you, give up on This unusual grief, and think of us As of a father.
Because, let the whole world know, You are the next in line to our throne, And, I give you my love, with no less nobility Than the love which the dearest father Bears his son.
As for your intentions To go back to school in Wittenberg, Leaving here is not something that we want, And we beg you to give into remaining Here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes, Our most important courtier, cousin, and our son.
Don’t let my prayers go unanswered, Hamlet.
I beg you to stay with us, don’t go to Wittenberg.
I’ll do my best to obey you, madam.
Why, it is a loving and a fair reply.
Behave as we would in Denmark.
Let’s go.
O God!
O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable All the habits of this world seem to me!
Shame on it!
O for shame!
It is an unweeded garden That is going to seed, only things that are decaying and Disgusting grow there.
That it should come to this!
Only dead for two months!
Heaven and earth!
Must I remember?
Weakness, your name is woman — A little month, even before those shoes with which she Followed my poor father's body were old, she was Totally inconsolable, all tears, why she, even she— O God!
a beast that lacks the gift of reason, Would have mourned longer— married my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I am like Hercules.
Within a month, Before the salt of the most wicked tears Had left the redness in her bitter eyes, She married.
O, most wicked speed, to travel With such quickness to incestuous sheets!
It is not good and it cannot come to good.
But, break my heart, for I must be silent!
Greetings to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well.
Or I do forget myself!
It’s me, my lord, and your poor servant forever.
And why are you here from Wittenberg, Horatio?
A lazy disposition, my good lord.
I wouldn’t even hear your enemy say so, And you shall not violently throw those words to my ear, To make my ear the keeper of your own report Against yourself.
I know you are not lazy.
But what are you doing in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink a lot before you leave!
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Please don’t mock me, fellow-student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Indeed, my lord, it followed very soon after.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!
The meats baked for the funeral Were also put on the marriage tables.
I wish I had met my dearest enemy in heaven Before I had ever seen that day, Horatio!
My father… I think I see my father.
Where, my lord?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.
My lord, I think I saw him last night.
My lord, the king your father.
The King my father!
Hold off your compliments for awhile And pay attention, until I may deliver, With the witness of these gentlemen, Something marvelous to you.
For God's love, let me hear what you have to say.
But where was this?
My lord, on the platform where we watched.
Didn’t you speak to it?
My lord, I did, But it made me no answer.
It is very strange.
I swear, my honored lord, it is true, And we thought it was our duty To let you know about it.
Are you going to watch again tonight?
We are, my lord.
He was armed, you say?
Armed, my lord.
From top to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then you didn’t see his face?
O, yes, my lord.
He had the front visor of his helmet up.
What, did he look like he was frowning?
His face showed more sorrow than anger.
Was he pale or red?
No, very pale.
And he fixed his eyes on you?
Most constantly.
I wish I had been there.
It would have amazed you very much.
I’m sure it would’ve, I’m sure it would’ve.
Did it stay long?
As long as an average person might count to a hundred.
Longer, longer.
Not when I saw it.
His beard was grizzly, no?
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A silvery sable.
I guarantee it will.
If it takes on my noble father's appearance, I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should open wide And order me to be silent.
I beg you all, If you have kept this sight secret so far, Keep your silence still, And whatever else shall happen tonight, Take it in, but don’t talk about it.
I will reward your loyalty.
So, goodbye for now.
On the platform, between eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.
Our duty to your honor.
Your loyalty, as mine to you.
Goodbye.
My father's spirit in arms!
I wish the night were here now!
Until then, sit still, my soul.
Wicked deeds will rise to be Seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth. 
The things I need are all on the ship.
Goodbye.
And, sister, as the winds will be favorable And the ships are strong to sail, don’t sleep, Until you let me hear from you.
Do you doubt that?
As for Hamlet and the foolishness of his attentions, Think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood.
Nothing more than that?
Stop thinking about it, Because nature, the moon, does not grow alone In strength and size, but as this temple grows, The inward duty of the mind and soul Grows wide along with the rest.
He may not, as lower persons do, Select for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be subject To the voice and consent of that state That he is the head of.
Then if he says he loves you, You would be wise to believe it Because then being in his particular act and place May do what he says, which is what The majority of people in of Denmark go along with.
So decide what loss your honor may receive If you listen to his songs with a too believing ear, Or lose your heart, or lose your virginity To his wild sense of bad timing.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep your affections deep within you, Out of the range and danger of desire.
The most careful maid is wasteful enough If she unmasks her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself doesn’t aim at lying deeds.
An ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring Too often before they have bloomed, And in the morning and liquid dew of youth Contagious shriveling is the most imminent.
Youth rebels against itself, even if no one else is near.
I shall keep the purpose of this good lesson As watchman to my heart.
But, my good brother, Don’t, as some insincere ministers do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, While, like a proud and reckless wild man, Preaches against the primrose path of sin And does not practice what he preaches.
O, don’t be afraid of me.
I’ve stayed too long.
But here comes my father.
A double blessing is a double grace, It’s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again.
You’re still here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the best part of your sail, And the ship waits for you.
There, my blessing with you!
And see that you write these few precepts In your memory.
Give your thoughts to yourself, And don’t act without thinking.
Be friendly, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends you have, and their friendship tested, Anchor them to your soul with hoops of steel, But don’t spend your money on entertaining Each newly acquired, unproven friend.
Beware Of getting into a quarrel, but, once you are in, Fight so that the man you fight with may beware of you.
This above all, to your own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, You cannot then be false to any man.
Goodbye.
My blessing instill these things in you!
I take my leave most humbly, my lord.
Goodbye, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
It is locked in my memory, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Goodbye.
What is it, Ophelia, that he has said to you?
If it pleases you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
By Mary, well thought.
What is going on between you?
Tell me the truth.
My lord, he has of late made many offers Of his affection to me.
Affection!
Pooh!
You speak like a green girl, Ignorant in such dangerous circumstances.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
My lord, I don’t know what I should think.
By Mary, I’ll teach you.
Think that you are a baby, That you have taken these offers for true love, Which are not true offers.
Consider yourself more dearly, Or, not to keep harping on that poor phrase, Doing harm to it, you'll “offer” me a fool!
My lord, he has courted me with love In honorable fashion.
And has given proper appearance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Yes, mousetraps to catch fools.
I do know, When passion burns the blood, how the wasteful soul Gives the tongue vows to speak.
These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, dead in both, Even in their promises, dying as they are being made, Must not be taken for real fire.
As for Lord Hamlet, Only believe so much about him, that he is young, And he may walk on a higher mountain Than may be given you.
In short, Ophelia, Don’t believe his vows, because they are pimps, Not made of those things which show outside, But mere beggars of unholy courtships, Breathing like holy and righteous procurers, The better to deceive you.
Do as I say, I order you.
Let’s go.
I shall obey, my lord. 
The air bites sharply, It is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What time is it now?
I think it’s just before twelve.
No, the clock has already struck twelve.
Indeed?
I didn’t hear it.
Then it’s getting close to the time When the spirit has his habit of walking.
What does that mean, my lord?
The King stays awake tonight and has a drinking party, Keeps toasting, and the swaggering morning whirls, And, as he drinks down his drafts of Rhine wine, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus noisily announce The triumph of his drinking it all down at once.
Is it a custom?
Yes, by Mary, it is, But to my mind, though I am a native here, And know the customs since birth, it is a custom More honored in the braking it than the observing it.
So often it might happen in particular men That, for some vicious disfigurement of nature in them, Like a birthmark— something they are not guilty of Because a man cannot choose how he is born— By the overdevelopment of some temperament, That often defies the intelligent use of reason, Or by some habit, that too much exceeds The limits of acceptable behavior, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being the result of nature, or a star of fortune, Whatever other virtues they have, even if they are As pure as grace, as infinite as men may have, Shall in the general opinion be labeled corrupt From that one particular fault.
The drop of affliction Often causes doubt about all the virtues they have To men’s own disgrace.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Whether you are a spirit of health or a goblin damned, Bringing with you airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Whether your intentions are wicked or charitable, You come in such a questionable shape That I will speak to you.
O, answer me!
Don’t let me burst in ignorance, but tell me Why your sacred bones, buried in death, Have escaped from the cemetery, why the tomb Wherein we saw you quietly laid to rest, Has opened his frightening and marble jaws To bring you back to life!
What does this mean, That you, dead corpse, again in full armor, Revisit us in the light and shadows of the moon, Making night hideous, and making us fools of nature Shake our dispositions so horridly With thoughts that go beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this?
Why?
What should we do?
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it had something to say To you alone.
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more private ground.
But don’t go with it!
No, by no means.
If it will not speak, then I will follow it.
Don’t, my lord.
Why, what should I be afraid of?
I don’t value my life at the price of a pin, And as for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing that is immortal as it is?
It waves me forward again.
I’ll follow it.
What if it tempts you toward the ocean, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea, And once there, assumes some other horrible form Which might deprive you of the ability to think, And draw you into madness?
Think about it.
The very place puts desperate ideas, Without any motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms into the sea And hears it roar beneath.
It waves me still.
Go on, I’ll follow you.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands.
Listen to me: you shall not go.
My fate cries out, And makes each and every vein in this body As hardy as the nerve of the lion killed by Hercules.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that holds me back!
I say, get away from me!
He’s getting crazy with expectation!
Let’s do it.
What will all this lead to?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will guide its course.
No, let's follow him. 
Where will you lead me?
Speak!
I’ll go no further.
Listen to me.
I will.
Don’t pity me, but listen seriously To what I shall disclose to you.
Speak, I am obliged to listen.
So you are obliged to revenge, when you shall hear me.
What?
I am your father's spirit, Doomed for a certain time to walk the night, And during the day I am confined to burn in fires, Until the evil crimes I had done in my life Are burnt and purged away.
If I were not forbidden To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could tell a tale whose lightest word Would crush your soul, freeze your young blood, Make your two eyes, like stars, jump from their sockets, Your knotted and combined hair to separate, And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills on the angry porcupine.
But this eternal description must not be given To ears of flesh and blood.
Listen, listen, O, listen!
If you ever loved your dear father — O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as even at best it is still murder, But this murder is the most foul, strange, and unnatural.
Tell me about it quickly, so that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May rush to my revenge.
I find you ready, And if you were duller than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on the river bank, You wouldn’t move on this.
Now, Hamlet, listen.
The story goes that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent bit me.
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle!
O Hamlet, what a falling-off there was in our marriage!
But as virtue can never be moved, it Was courted though lewdness in a shape of heaven, And lust, though linked to a radiant angel, Will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed And eat garbage.
But wait!
O, horrible!
O, horrible!
Most horrible!
But, however you pursue this revenge, Don’t taint your mind, or let your soul plan Anything against your mother.
Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that live in her bosom, To prick and sting her.
Goodbye now!
The glowworm shows the morning is near, And he begins to put out his ineffective fire.
Goodbye, goodbye!
Hamlet, remember me.
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
what else?
And shall I join forces hell?
O, for shame!
Remember you!
Yes, you poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this confused world.
Remember you!
Yes, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all unimportant records, All kinds of books, all pictures, all pressures past, That my youth and observations wrote there, And your commandment all by itself shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with other low thoughts.
Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My papers, it is just that I set it all down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain, At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are.
Now to my word: It is Goodbye, goodbye!
remember me.
I have sworn it.
So be it!
Hello, ho, ho, my lord!
Hello, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.
How are you, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
O, wonderful!
My good lord, tell it.
No, you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Nor I, my lord.
What do you say then, would heart of man once think it?
And you'll keep it secret?
Yes, by heaven, my lord.
There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark Except that he's an arrant knave.
We don’t need a ghost, my lord, to come from the grave To tell us this.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I’m sorry they offend you, heartily, Yes, indeed, heartily.
There's no offense, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.
Regarding this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that I can tell you.
As for your desire to know what happened between us, Control it the best you can.
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
What is it, my lord?
We will.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
My lord, we will not.
No, but swear it.
Really, My lord, I would not.
Nor I, my lord, really.
Swear on my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, on my sword, indeed.
Swear.
Are you there, trusty fellow?
Come on!
Tell us the oath, my lord.
Swear.
You are everywhere?
then we'll move our ground.
Come over here, gentlemen, And lay your hands again on my sword.
Never to speak of what you have heard, Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Well said, old mole!
Can you work in the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!
Once more, leave, good friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore, as a stranger, welcome it.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Swear.
Rest, rest, irritated spirit!
Let’s go in together, And still keeping your silence, I beg you.
The time is so out of whack.
O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!
No, come, let's go together. 
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You would do very well, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to ask someone About his behavior.
My lord, I did intend to ask.
By Mary, well said, very well said.
Look here, sir, First ask what Danes are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they live, What company, at what expense, and finding, By this talking around and drift of questions, That they who do know my son, come nearer to you Than your particular questions will touch it.
Assume, as it were, that you have only heard about him, Such as, “I know his father and his friends, And in part him”, are you listening to me, Reynaldo?
Yes, very well, my lord.
And in part him, but,” you may say, “not very well.
As gaming, my lord.
Yes, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Prostitution.
You may go that far.
My lord, that would dishonor him.
Just as you mention it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to inconstancy.
Just tell his faults so quaintly That they may seem to be the stains of freedom, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in wild blood, An attack that everyone goes through.
But, my good lord, Why should you do this?
Yes, my lord, I want to know that.
By Mary, sir, here's my intention:, And I believe it is a trick of protection.
And then, sir, ask if he does this, does he--What was I about to say?
So, using my lecture and advice from before, You shall check on my son.
You understand me, yes?
My lord, I do.
My good lord!
Observe his inclinations in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him practice his music.
Well, my lord.
Goodbye!
Alas, my lord, I have been so frightened!
By what, in the name of God?
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his shirt all unbuttoned, No hat upon his head, his stockings dirty, Not pulled up, and fallen down around his ankles, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking together, And with a look so pitiful in its meaning As if he had been freed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
Crazy for your love?
My lord, I don’t know, But I truly fear it.
What did he say?
He took me by the wrist, and held me hard, Then he went to the length of his whole arm, And with his other hand like this over his brow, He started such study of my face As though he wanted to draw it.
Come, go with me.
I will look for the king.
This is the very passion of love Whose violent property kills itself, And leads the will to desperate undertakings As often as any passion under heaven That afflicts our natures.
No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did reject his letters and denied His access to me.
That has made him crazy.
I am sorry that I didn’t treat him with better heed and Judgment.
I was afraid he was only trifling with you And meant to wreck you, but curse my jealousy!
It seems it is as proper for our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
Come, let’s go to the king.
This must be known, which, if kept secret, might mean More trouble to hide it than hate for utter love. 
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
In addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for A long time, the reason we need to see you made us Send our hasty invitation.
What the problem should be, More than his father's death that has put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.
I beg you both That, being childhood friends and brought up with him, And since you know well his youth and disposition, That you will be pleased to rest here in our court For a while, so that, with your company, you Draw him on to enjoy himself, and to gather, So much as from any occasion you may glean, Whether anything, unknown to us, afflicts him like this, That, once we know, we can make better.
Good gentlemen, he has much talked of you, And I am sure that there are not living two men With whom he feels close.
If you will please Show us so much gentry and goodwill As to spend your time with us a while, To help us find out what is troubling him, Your visit shall receive such thanks As only a King can give.
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your huge request more into a command Than to an entreaty.
We both obey, And here we give up ourselves, without reservation, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beg you instantly to visit My too much changed son.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
May the heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Yes, amen!
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.
You have always been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord?
I assure you, my good lord, I believe my duty is, as I believe in my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king.
And I do think— or else this brain of mine Doesn’t know the trail of policy as surely As it used to do—, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
Introduce yourself to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my sweet queen, he has found The head and source of all your son's unhappiness.
I doubt it is none other than the main reason, His father's death and our overly hasty marriage.
Well, we shall figure him out.
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what news from our ally, Norway?
We really like this news, And later when we have more time we'll read this Request, answer, and think upon this business.
In the meantime, we thank you for a job well done.
Get some rest, tonight we'll feast together.
A great welcome home!
This business is well ended.
Crazy” I call it, because to define true craziness, What is it except to be nothing else but crazy?
But ignore that.
Madam, I swear I use no clever words at all.
It remains like this, and the remainder like this.
Consider.
I have a daughter, have while she is mine, Who, in her duty and obedience, listen, Has given me this.
Now listen and understand.
You may doubt you that the stars are fire, ”You may doubt that the sun does move, ”You may doubt truth to be a liar, ”But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am sick at the number of my sighs, I don’t have the skill to calculate my groans.
but that I love you best, O most best, believe it.
Adieu.
Yours evermore, most dear lady, while this brain is in him, HAMLET.
This my daughter has shown this to me in obedience, And furthermore, has his gifts, Which she has described to me by the time, by means, and place they were received.
But how has she Received his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honorable.
I would gladly prove so.
Do you think it is this?
It may be, very likely.
Has there been such a time, I’d gladly know that, That I have positively said “it is so,” And it wasn’t?
Not that I know of.
Take this from this, if this isn’t the case now.
If get the opportunity, I will find Where truth is hidden, though it were hidden indeed Within the centre of the man.
How can we find out more?
You know sometimes he walks for hours and hours Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time, I’ll make sure my daughter meets him.
You and I will be behind a curtain then, Listening to their encounter.
If he doesn’t love her, And he’s not gone crazy because of love, Let me be no assistant for a state, But be a farmer and horse carter.
We will try it.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
O, give me permission.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well, God have mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Not I, my lord.
Then I wish you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord!
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breeds maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing rotten flesh— Have you a daughter?
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk in the sun.
Pregnancy is a blessing, but not as your daughter may get pregnant.
Friend, look to it.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.
He is far gone, far gone!
In my youth I truly suffered much agony for love almost like this.
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you are reading, my lord.
all of which, sir, although I believe it most powerfully and potently, yet I think it was dishonest to have written it like this, because you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
Into my grave?
Indeed, that is out of the air.
Aside.
How full of meaning his replies sometimes are!
A happiness that often craziness hits on, which reason and sanity couldn’t arranged so happily.
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part with, except my life, except my life, except my life.
Goodbye, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
God save you, sir!
My honored lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends!
How are you, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do you both?
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
God, we are her privates.
In the secret parts of fortune?
What's the news?
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Prison, my lord!
Denmark's a prison.
Then the world is one.
A goodly one, in which there are many cells, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
We don’t think so, my lord.
Why, then it is not a prison to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so.
To me, it is a prison.
O God, I could be put into a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, if it were not that I have bad dreams.
Those dreams are indeed ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
Then our beggars are bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes are the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to the court?
for, by my faith, I cannot reason.
We'll wait upon you.
That’s not necessary.
I won’t sort you with the rest of my servants, because, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended.
But, in the beaten way of friendship, what are you doing at Elsinore?
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are a halfpenny too expensive.
Weren’t you sent for?
Is it your own desire to come here?
Is it a free visit?
Come on, Tell me the truth.
What should we say, my lord?
Why, anything but to the answer.
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which you are not very good at hiding.
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
What for, my lord?
You have to tell me.
But let me beg you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the harmony of our youth, by the obligation of our ever preserved love, and by anything else that could charge you to be even and direct with me, were you were sent for or not?
What do you say?
My lord, we were sent for.
I have of late, but why I don’t know, lost all my joy, given up all habits of exercises, and indeed, I am so depressed that this good frame, the earth, seems to me to be a sterile outpost, this most excellent canopy, the air— look—, this brave sky hanging over us, this majestic roof divided with golden fire, why, it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors.
What a piece of work is man!
How noble in reason!
how infinite in faculties!
in form and moving, how expressive and admirable!
In action how like an angel!
in understanding, how like a god!
And yet, to me, what is this highly refined speck of dust?
Man doesn’t delight me, no, nor woman either, though by your smiling, you seem to find that funny.
My lord, there wasn’t any such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said, “Man doesn’t delight me”?
To think, my lord, if you do not delight in man, what a somber reception the players shall receive from you.
We passed them on the way, and they are coming here to perform.
What players are they?
Even those you usually enjoy, the tragedians of the city.
How is it that they travel?
Being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits.
I think their traveling to perform a play is a new innovation.
Do they hold the same respect they did when I was in the city?
Are they still followed?
No, indeed, they are not.
Why?
Do they grow rusty?
No, their work keeps them at their usual pace, but there is, sir, a brood of children, untrained, that complicate their situation, and are most tyrannically beaten for it.
Children are now very popular, and are on the common stages, as they call them, so much that many actors are afraid they cannot compete and barely dare to come there.
What, are they children?
Who cares for them?
Where do they live?
Will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing?
Won’t they say later, if they should go on to become common players, which is likely, and their lives are no better, that their writers did them wrong to make them exclaim against their own success?
Well, there has been a lot of comment on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy.
There was, for a while, no money paid for debate unless the poet and the player fought over the question.
Is it possible?
O, there has been a lot of bashing of brains going on.
Do the boys carry them away?
Yes, they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too.
It is not very strange, for my uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make faces at him while my father lived, paid twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats each for a little picture of him.
God’s blood!, there is something more than natural in this, if philosophy could figure it out.
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Let me shake your hands.
The accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony.
Let me comply with it in these clothes, for fear that my welcome to the players, which I tell you must look good, should more appear like entertainment than your plays.
You are welcome.
but my uncle-father and aunt- mother are deceived.
In what, my dear lord?
I am but crazy north-north-west.
When the wind is from the south, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Welcome, gentlemen!
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, with each ear.
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes.
Happily this is the second time he uses them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
I predict he comes to tell me of the players, listen.
You say right, sir.
On Monday morning, it was true indeed.
Buzz, buzz!
Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light.
For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure you had!
What treasure did he have, my lord?
Why,“One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well.” Still harping on my daughter.
Am I not in the right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
No, that doesn’t follow.
What follows, then, my lord?
Why, “As by lot, God knows,” and then, you know,”It came to pass, as most like it was.” The first line of the holy song will show you more, for look where my means of whiling away the time comes.
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all.
I am glad to see you well.
Welcome, good friends.
What, my young lady and mistress!
By our lady, your ladyship is taller than when I saw you last, by the height of a high-heeled shoe.
Pray God, your voice, like a an unused gold coin, can’t be cracked within the ring.
Masters, you are all welcome.
We'll act up like French falconers: fly at anything we see.
We'll have a speech right now.
Come, give us a bit of your quality.
Come, a passionate speech.
What speech, my lord?
I heard you do a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not more than once, for the play, I remember, didn’t please the crowd, it was caviar to the particular, but it was, as I took it, and others, whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine, an excellent play, well organized in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as skill.
I remember, one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy, and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs, but called it an honest effort, as wholesome as it was sweet, and, by very much, more handsome than fine.
If you can remember it, begin at this line, let me see, let me see.
By God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good judgment.
Eventually he finds him, Striking too short at the Greeks.
His old sword, Rebelling against his arm, lies where it falls, Resisting his commands.
Not matched equally, Pyrrhus lunges at Priam, strikes wild in rage, But, with the whiff and wind of his fierce sword, The shaken father falls.
Then senseless Priam, Seeming to feel this blow, flaming at his top Stoops to his base, and, with a hideous crash, Cuts off prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.
Behold!
his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seemed in the air to stick.
So, like a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And, as if not giving in to his will and body, Did nothing.
But, as we often see a silence in the heavens, After some storm, the gales stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the earth below As hushed as death, and eventually the dreadful thunder Tears the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, A roused anger renews him and he begins to work, And never did the One-eyed monster’s hammers fall On the god of war’s amour, forged for eternal strength, With less sorrow than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, you loose woman, Fortune!
All you gods, In general meeting, take away her power, Break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel, And bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of heaven, As low as you can to kill the fiends!
This is too long.
It shall go to the barber's, to be cut with your beard.
I beg you, continue.
He's for a jig or a dirty tale, or he sleeps.
Continue, come to Hecuba.
Wrapped up queen” is good.
Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With blind tears, a cloth on that head Where lately the crown had stood, and for a robe, About her thin loins, exhausted from child-bearing, A blanket, caught up in the panic of fear, Whoever had seen this, with a very poisoned tongue, Would have pronounced treason against Fortune's state.
But if the gods themselves saw her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport By chopping her husband’s limbs with his sword, The instant burst of noise that she made, Unless mortal events can’t move them at all, Would have made the burning eyes of heaven milk, And rouse passion in the gods.
Look, where he has turned pale, and has tears in his eyes.
I beg you, no more!
It is well.
I’ll have you speak out the rest of this soon.
My good lord, will you see the players well taken care of?
Do you hear me?
Let them be well used, for they are the short stories and brief history of the time.
After you die, it would be better to have a bad epitaph then than their ill report while you live now.
My lord, I will use them according to their class.
God’s bodkin, man, better.
Use every man according to his class, and who should escape whipping?
Use them according to your class.
The less they deserve it, the more credit it is to you.
Take them in.
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends.
we'll hear a play tomorrow.
Do you hear me, old friend?
We'll have it tomorrow night.
Yes, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that lord, and see you don’t mock him.
I’ll leave you till night.
You are welcome to Elsinore.
My good lord!
Yes, so, God be with you!
Now I am alone.
O, what a idle, wandering, and peasant slave I am!
Isn’t it monstrous that this actor here, Only in a play, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own actions That his grew pale from the words of the speech, Tears in his eyes, separation from reality in his face, A broken voice, and his whole function matching Forms to his role?
And all for nothing!
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?
What would he do If he had the motive and the cue for passion That I have?
He would drown the stage with tears And split the audience’s with horrid speech, Make the guilty crazy, and shock the innocent, Confuse the ignorant, and amaze, indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain?
Breaks my head across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose?
Lies about me in the throat As deep as the lungs?
Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass I am!
This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murdered, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, release the content of my heart with words, and fall down cursing like a very drab, Menial servant in the kitchen!
Shame on it!
Argh!
Change course, my brain!
I have Heard that guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have been so struck to the soul By the very cunning of the scene that presently They have confessed their evil deeds, Because murder, although it is silent, will speak With its own most miraculous organ, I’ll have these Players play something like the murder of my father Before my uncle.
I’ll observe his looks, I’ll watch his every move.
Even if he only winks, I know what I have to do.
I’ll need to have more proof than this.
The play's the thing Wherein I’ll see the conscience of the king. 
And can’t you, by any circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this craziness, Grating all his days of quiet so harshly With turbulence and dangerous lunacy?
He does confess that he feels himself troubled, But he will by no means speak about the cause.
Nor do we find him easy to figure out the reason why, Because, with a crafty craziness, keeps his distance When we try to bring him to some confession Of his true state.
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
But with much forcing to make himself do it.
Difficult to question, but, when we ask for something, He is most free in his reply.
Did you try to get him To engage in any pastime?
Madam, it just so happened that certain players We passed on the way here.
We told him about them, And it seemed to make him happy To hear of it.
They are here at the court, And, I think, they are already hired To play before him tonight.
This is very true, And he begged me to invite your majesties To hear and see the play.
With all my heart, and it makes me happy To hear that he is so inclined.
Good gentlemen, cut him some slack, And keep his attentions on these delights.
We shall, my lord.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, For we have secretly sent for Hamlet to come here, That here he may, as if by accident Meet Ophelia.
Her father and I, lawful spies, Will so hide ourselves that, seeing but unseen, We may honestly judge their encounter, And gather from him, or how he behaves, If it’s the affliction of his love or not That he suffers like this for.
I really hope your virtues Will bring him to his usual way again, To the honor of both of you.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, you walk here.
Gracious king, if it pleases you, We will bestow ourselves.
Read this book, Showing that such an exercise may colours Your loneliness.
We are often to blame in this, it’s been proven often, that with devotion's face and holy actions, we sugar over The Devil himself.
O, it is too true!
How hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience!
The prostitute's cheek, covered with makeup, Isn’t more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my very artificial words.
O heavy burden!
I hear him coming.
Let's hide, my lord.
There's the respect That makes a mess of long life, For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's insults, The pangs of rejected love, the law's delay, The inexperience of office, and the disdain That patient merit takes from the unworthy, When he himself might his final settlement make With a bare, sharp knife?
Who would bear these burdens To grunt and sweat under a weary life, Except that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose borders No traveler returns, puzzles the mind, And makes us bear those problems we have Rather than fly to others that we don’t know about?
In this way, a conscience can make cowards of us all, And in this way the natural color of making up your mind Is covered with the pale shadow of thinking, And projects of great substance and significance, And in this regard, their movement turns erratic, And lose the name of action.
Wait!
The fair Ophelia!
Nymph, in your eyes May all my sins be remembered.
My good lord, How has your honor been for this many a day?
I humbly thank you, Well, well, well.
My lord, I have mementos of yours That I have longed to re-deliver to you for a long time.
I beg you, take them back now.
My honored lord, you know right well you did, And with them, words composed of so sweet an air As made the things more rich.
Their sweet air being Gone, take them back again, because to the noble mind Rich gifts grow poor when the givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
Are you sincere?
My lord?
Are you truthful?
What do you mean?
That if you be sincere and truthful, your sincerity shouldn’t have any talks to your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better dealings than with sincerity?
Yes, truly, for the power of beauty will transform sincerity from what it is to a pimp faster than the force of sincerity can translate beauty into his image.
This used to be contradictory, but now the time proves it’s true.
I did love you once.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
You should not have believed me, for virtue can’t graft a new plant onto our old stock but we shall relish of it.
I didn’t love you.
I was deceived all the more.
Get yourself to a convent.
Why would you give birth to sinners?
I don’t care about my sincerity, but I could accuse myself of such things that it were better my mother had not had me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my command than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to commit them in.
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?
We are wicked men, all, believe none of us.
Take yourself a convent.
Where's your father?
At home, my lord.
Shut the doors on him, that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house.
Goodbye.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
If you do, by Mary, I’ll give you this curse for your wedding gift: whether you as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, you shalt not escape slander.
Go to a convent, go.
Goodbye.
Or, if you will marry, make it a fool, by Mary, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
To a convent, go, and quickly too.
Goodbye.
O heavenly powers, restore him!
You dance, you walk, and you whisper and nickname animals, and make your looseness your ignorance.
I say, we will have no more marriages.
those that are married already, all but one, shall live, the rest stay the same.
To a convent, go.
O, what a noble mind here is conquered!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, voice, sword, The hope and flower of Denmark, The mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite taken down!
And I of all ladies most dejected and wretched That has tasted the honey of his musical vows, Now see that noble and most royal mind, Like sweet bells jangling, out of tune and harsh to hear, That form and feature of blown youth without equal Totally crazy.
O, woe is me, To have seen the man I have seen, see the man I see!
Love!
his affections don’t go that way, And what he said, though it was a little unorganized, Wasn’t like craziness.
There's something in his soul Over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg, And I doubt that egg will hatch and the “bird” Will be something dangerous, which to prevent, I have quickly decided To write it down like this.
Happily the seas, and different countries With other things, shall cure and get rid of This problem in his heart that has such a hold on him, Which his still active brain makes him like this From being himself.
What do you think about it?
It’ll be OK.
But I still believe The source and beginning of his grief Began with rejected love.
How are you, Ophelia!
My lord, do as you please, But if you think it’s OK, after the play, Let his queen mother talk to him all alone and beg him To share his problem.
Let her be strict with him, And I’ll be hide, if it pleases you, so I can hear Of all their conference.
If she can’t find out what’s wrong, Then send him to England, or lock him up where You think is the best place.
That’s what I’ll do.
Craziness in great ones must not go unwatched. 
Speak the part, I beg you, as I read it to you, lightly on your tongue.
But if you just repeat it, as many actors do, I would prefer the town crier spoke my lines.
O, it offends me to the soul to hear a hefty fellow with a wig tear an emotion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the cheap seats, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but confusing pantomime and noise.
Please avoid it.
I assure you.
But don’t be too tame either, but let your own discretion be your teacher.
Fit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special rule, that you don’t overstep the simplicity of being natural, for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature, to show truth in reality, scorn her falseness, and his form and force to the very age and body of the time.
Now, this overacting, or lateness, though it make the ignorant laugh, can only make the experienced grieve, in whose opinion, you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance.
O, there are actors that I have seen perform and heard others praise, and highly too, not to speak too harshly, that, having neither the accent of Christians, nor the walk of a Christian, a pagan, or a man, have so strutted and yelled that I have thought some of nature's hired help had made them and not made them well, they imitated mankind so dreadfully.
I hope we have calmly overcome those problems, sir.
O, overcome them with zeal.
That's horrible and shows very bad manners in the fool that uses it.
Go get ready.
How are you, my lord!
Will the king hear this piece of work?
And the queen too, and they should be here presently.
We will, my lord.
What, here, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, you are just like the man That my conversation just now praised.
Why should the poor be flattered?
No, let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory, And bend the obvious hinges of the knee Where poverty may follow flattery.
Do you hear me?
Since my dear soul controlled her choice, And could recognize men of truth, her choice Has taken you for herself.
Because you have been As one, that in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that Fortune's feasts and rewards Have taken with equal thanks, and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well blended That they are not an instrument for Fortune's finger To play whatever song she pleases.
Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, yes, in my heart of heart, As I do you.
OK, enough of that.
There is a play tonight before the king.
One scene of it comes near the circumstances, Which I have told you, of my father's death.
I beg you, when you see that act begin, Even with the very criticism of your soul Watch my uncle.
If his hidden guilt Don’t show itself in that one speech, It is a false ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as unstable As god of fire’s anvil.
Watch him carefully, Because I will have my eyes riveted on his face, And, after the play, we will combine our observations In condemning of his actions.
Well, my lord.
If he steals anything the while this play is going on, And he escapes detection, I will pay for the theft.
They are coming to the play.
I must be idle.
Go get yourself a seat.
How’s our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, really, of the chameleon's dish.
I eat the air, crammed with promises.
You can’t eat capons that way.
No, for me now.
My lord, you acted once when you were in the university, you say?
That did I, my lord, and I was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar, I was killed in the Capitol, Brutus killed me.
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a stupid fellow there.
Are the players ready?
Come hear, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
O, ho!
Do you see that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, lay my head on your lap?
Yes, my lord.
Do you think I meant sexual matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, me?
Yes, my lord.
O, your only dancer!
What should a man do but be merry?
Because look how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
No, it is four months, my lord.
So long?
No then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of black fur.
O heavens!
Died two months ago and not forgotten yet?
By Mary, this is miching mallecho, it means mischief.
It’s as if this show describes the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep a secret, they'll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Yes, or any show that you'll show him.
If you are not ashamed to show, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
Keep quiet, keep quiet.
I’ll watch the play.
For us and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg you listen patiently.
Is this a prologue or a ring of flowers?
It is short, my lord.
As woman's love.
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us count again before love is finished!
That I don’t trust you.
Now, you know how I love you has been proven to you, And as my love is cannot be measured, so is my fear.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are very fearful, Where little fears grow great, great love also grows there.
Such love must be treason in my breast.
Let me be cursed if I marry again!
No one marries the second without killing the first love.
The reasons for a second marriage Are low respects of saving money, but not for love.
I kill my husband dead a second time When second husband kisses me in bed.
I believe you believe what you say now, But what we determine to, often we don’t.
Promises are only good when you remember them, Born of violence but poor truth, Which now, like unripe fruit, stays on the tree, But fall without shaking them off when they are ripe.
It is very necessary that we forget To pay ourselves what we owe to ourselves.
What we promise ourselves in a fit of passion, When the passion ends, so does the promise.
The violence of either grief or joy Destroys their own keeping of them with themselves.
Where joy celebrates, grief mourns greatly, Grief joys, joy griefs, on a very slender event.
This world doesn’t say yes, and it’s not strange at all That even our loves should change with our fortunes, Because it’s a question we have to prove, When love leads fortune, or if fortune leads love.
But, to go back to where I started, Our wills and fates run in so much in different directions, That our plans are still turned upside down, Our thoughts are ours, but their results aren’t ours.
So you think you won’t marry again, But you’ll change your mind when your first lord is dead.
If she should break the moment now!
It is a very deep oath.
Sleep rock your brain, And may misfortune never mischance between us two!
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady protests too much, I think.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the story?
It’s not offensive, is it?
No, no!
They only pretend, pretend to poison, no offense in the world.
What’s the name of the play?
The Mousetrap.
By Mary, how?
A metaphor.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
but what o' that?
your majesty, and we that have free souls can’t be touched by it.
Let the bitter hussy kick, our saddles don’t pinch.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
You are a good chorus, my lord.
I could translate between you and your love, if I could see the toys flirting.
You are forward, my lord, you are forward.
It would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me.
Even better, and worse.
And that’s how you must take your husbands.
Begin, murderer, argh!
Enough with the bad faces, and begin.
He poisons him in the garden for his estate.
His name's Gonzago.
The King rises.
What, frightened by false fire!
How are you, my lord?
Stop the play.
Give me some light.
Let’s go!
Lights, lights, lights!
Wouldn’t this do it, sir, together with a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn against with me, with two Provincial roses on my shoes I took off, to get me a fellowship for writing with a pack of players, sir?
Half a share.
You might have rhymed those lines.
O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost's word for as real as a thousand dollars!
Did you see?
Very well, my lord.
When the talk was about the poisoning?
I watched him very well.
Ah, ha!
Come, some music!
Come, some music!
My good my lord, may I a word with you.
Sir, I’ll give you a whole history.
The king, sir Yes, sir, what about him?
He’s, in his retirement to bed, exceedingly upset.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord, rather with anger.
You’d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor, because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry.
My good lord, please re-phrase what you’re saying, and don’t give me answers so far away from my question.
I am calm, sir.
Ask away.
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, has sent me to you.
You are welcome.
No, good my lord, this courtesy is not the right answer.
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command, or rather, as you say, my mother shall command.
OK, I’ll say no more but to the problem.
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!
But isn’t there a sequel that follows this mother's surprise?
She wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
We shall obey, if she were ten times our mother.
Have you any else to tell me?
My lord, you loved me once.
And I still do, by these thieves and robbers.
My good lord, what is your cause of your problem?
You certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you don’t tell your problems to your friend.
Sir, I don’t have a promotion.
How can that be, when the king himself says you will succeed him to the throne in Denmark?
Yes, sir, but “While the grass grows”— the proverb is a bit old-fashioned.
O, the pipes.
Let me see one.
To divert your attention, why do you go about trying to figure me out, as if you’re to pick a fight?
O my lord, if my duty is too bold, it’s because my love has no manners.
I don’t understand that at all.
Will you play on this pipe?
My lord, I can’t.
I beg you.
Believe me, I can’t.
I’m begging you.
I don’t know how to play it, my lord.
It’s as easy as lying.
Just close up these holes with your finger and thumb, put it in your mouth and blow, and it will yield the most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the holes to cover.
Why, look here, at what an unworthy a thing you make of me!
You would play me, you would seem to know my holes to cover, you want to pick out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest note to the my highest note, and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little pipe, yet you can’t play it.
Do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe?
Call me whatever instrument you want to, although you can try to cover my holes me, you can’t play me.
God bless you, sir!
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right now.
Do you see that cloud over there that's almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, it is indeed like a camel.
I think it is like a weasel.
It is shaped like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then I will go to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
By-and-by is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
Now, it’s the very witching time of night, When churchyards awake, and hell itself breathes out Disease to this world.
Now I could drink hot blood, And do such wicked deed that the day Would shake nervously to see.
Listen!
now to my mother.
O heart, don’t give up now, don’t ever let the soul of Nero, the crazy emperor, enter this determined heart.
I don’t like him, and it doesn’t seem to be safe to us To let his craziness run free.
The terms of our estate may not endure With danger so near to us as his craziness seems To get worse by the hour.
We will get ourselves ready.
It’s a most holy and religious fear To keep those many, many bodies safe That depend upon your majesty.
The single and peculiar life is bound, With all the strength and amour of the mind, To keep itself from madness, but much more so For that spirit on whose government the lives of many Depend and rest.
The government of a King Dies with him, but draws what's near it with it, like a gulf.
It is a massive wheel, Set at the top of the highest mountain, In which its huge spokes, ten thousand little things Are firmly glued together, that, when the wheel falls, Each small piece, insignificant event, Adds to the noisy ruin of the country.
The King never Sighed by himself, but with the whole country’s groan.
Get started, I beg you, on this speedy voyage, For we will control this fear, Which now goes about too freely.
We will go quickly.
My lord, he's going to his mother's bedroom.
I’ll hide myself behind the curtain so I can hear what happens, I’ll guarantee she'll set him Straight.
And, as you said, and wisely it was said, It is proper that some beside his mother, Since nature makes them subjective, should overhear The speech objectively.
Goodbye, my lord.
I’ll call on you before you go to bed, And tell you what I know.
Thanks, my dear lord.
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with my brother's blood, Isn’t there enough rain in the sweet heavens To wash it as white as snow?
What use is mercy Except to confront the face of offense?
And what's in prayer except this double force, To be prevented from falling down, Or pardoned since we are down?
Then I’ll look up, My sin is committed.
But, O, what form of prayer Can help me?
Forgive me of my foul murder!
That can’t be it, since I still have All those things for which I did the murder, My crown, my own ambition, and my queen.
May one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits?
What then?
What stops?
I’ll see what being sorry does.
What can’t it do?
O heart as black as death!
O dissolving soul, that, struggling to be free, Is more a slave!
Help, angels!
Make an attempt.
Bow, stubborn knees, and, heart, with strings of steel, Be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby!
All may be well.
I must think about that.
A villain kills my father, and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven.
O, this is a contract and pay, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of food, With all his sins on his soul, as full of bloom as May, And how his report stands, who knows except heaven?
No.
Up, sword, and know a more horrid intention.
When he is asleep drunk, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing, or committing some act That has no element of salvation in it, Then attack him, so that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell, where it goes to.
My mother is waiting.
This relief only makes your sickly days longer.
My words go up, my thoughts stay here below.
Words without thoughts never go to heaven. 
He will come right away.
See that you are direct with him.
Tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up With, and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because Of him.
I’ll hide here silently.
I beg you, be firm with him.
Hide, I hear him coming.
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, you have offended your father very much.
Mother, you have offended my father very much.
Come, come, you answer me stupidly.
Go, go, you answer me with wickedness.
Why, how can you, Hamlet!
What's the matter now?
Have you forgotten I’m your mother?
No, by the church, I haven’t.
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife, And, I wish it wasn’t so, but you are my mother.
No, then, I’ll send those to you who can speak.
What will you do?
You wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
What, ho!
help, help, help!
Draws.
O, I am slain!
O me, what have you done?
No, I don’t know.
Is it the king?
O, what a thoughtless and bloody deed this is!
A bloody deed!
Almost as bad, good mother, As killing a king and marrying his brother.
As killing a king!
Yes, lady, that’s what I said.
You wretched, rash, intruding fool, goodbye!
I mistook you for the King.
Leave wringing of your hands.
Quiet!
What have I done, that you dare scream at me So loudly and rudely?
Heaven's face glows— Yes, this solid and compound body With a trustful face— as against the end of the world, Is sickened by the thought of the act.
Ah me, what act Roars so loudly and thunders in the wind?
Look here upon this picture and on this one, The representation of two brothers.
Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear of corn Poisoning his wholesome brother.
Have you got eyes?
Could you feed on this fair mountain, And glut yourself on this swamp?
Huh?
have you got Eyes?
What devil Was it that trick you like this with a blindfold?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling without them all, Or a sickly part of one true sense Couldn’t act like this without a conscious thought.
O shame!
Aren’t you embarrassed?
Rebellious hell, If you can rebel in an old lady’s bones, Then let virtue be like wax to burning youth, And melt in her own fire.
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive passion takes charge, Since frost itself burns as well, And reason pimps the will.
O Hamlet, don’t say anything else.
You turn my eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grainy spots As will not leave their color.
No, but to live In the rotten sweat of an greasy bed, Stewed in corruption, using sweet words and making love Over the nasty pig sty.
No more.
A king of shreds and patches!
Save me and hover over me with your wings, You heavenly guards!
What does you gracious figure want?
Alas, he's crazy!
Don’t you come to scold your tardy son, That, forgetting time and passion, lets The important acting of your dread command go by?
O, tell me!
Don’t forget.
This visitation Is only to sharpen your almost dull purpose.
But, look, amazement sits on your mother’s face.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
How are you, lady?
Alas, how are you, That you look on empty space, And carry on a conversation with the invisible air?
Your spirits wildly peep from your eyes, And, as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm, Your bedded hairs, like life in growths, Start up and stand an end.
O gentle son, Sprinkle cool patience on the heat and flame of your Anger!
Where do you look?
On him, on him!
Look how pale he glares!
Then what I have to do Will need true colours, tears perhaps for blood.
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all, yet all that I see is.
You hear nothing?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look there!
Look how it steals away!
My father in his clothes as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now out the door!
This is the very product of your brain.
This bodiless creation Is very cunning In imagination.
Imagination!
My pulse does temperately keep time like yours, And is just as healthful as yours.
It’s not craziness That I have spoken.
Test me, And I will re-word the problem, which madness Would run away from.
Mother, for love of grace, Don’t put that flattering oil on your soul That says my craziness speaks and not your sin.
It will only create a scab and film over the ulcer, While rotten corruption, working within everything, Infects it unseen.
Confess yourself to heaven, Repent what's past, avoid what is to come, And don’t spread fertilizer on the weeds, To make them more rotten.
Forgive me my truth, Because, in the fatness of these wealthy times Virtue itself must beg pardon of vice, Yes, beg and court for permission to do him good.
O Hamlet, you cut my heart in two.
O, throw away the worse part of it, And live the purer life with the other half.
but don’t go to my uncle's bed, Act as though you have a virtue if you don’t have it.
That monster habit, who eats all sense, Of all evil habits is an angel in this, That in order to use fair and good actions, He likewise gives a dress or uniform That is ready to wear.
The next more easy, For use can almost change what is natural, And can either curb the devil or throw him out With wondrous effectiveness.
I am sorry, but heaven has decided it to be this way, To punish me with this act, and punish this act with me, That I must be their whip and whip-er.
I will hide him, and will answer the death I gave him well.
So again, goodnight.
One word more, good lady.
What shall I do?
Don’t think it’s good to tell him, For who except a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would hide from a frog, from a bat, a cat, Such dear concerns?
Who would do so?
No, in spite of sense and secrecy, Don’t open the basket on the roof, Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape To test conclusions, don’t creep into the basket And break your own neck.
Be assured, if words are made of breath, And breath is made of life, I have no life to breathe What you have said to me.
I must go to England, you know that?
Alack, I had forgotten.
Let it be, Because it’s the sport to have the swordsman Killed with his own sword, and it won’t be easy But I will dig one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon.
O, it is most sweet, When you can kill two birds with one stone.
Mother, goodnight.
Indeed, this counselor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was a foolish gabby rogue in life.
Come, sir, to finish up with you.
Good night, mother. 
There's a problem in these sighs.
Where is your son?
Leave us alone for a little while.
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How is Hamlet?
As crazy as the sea and wind, when both fight over Which is mightier.
In his wild fit, Hearing something stir behind the curtain, He whips out his knife, cries 'A rat, a rat!
And in this headstrong state, kills The hidden good old man.
O heavy deed!
It would’ve been us if we had been there.
His freedom is full of threats to everyone, To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be explained?
It will be our fault, who Should’ve kept this mad young man on a short leash, Restrained, and out of society.
But we loved him so much That we would not understand what was the best action, But, like the owner of a dirty disease, To keep it from showing, let it feed Even on the core of life.
Where has he gone?
He weeps for what is done.
O Gertrude, let’s go!
Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go get some further assistance.
Hamlet has Polonius slain in insanity, And he has dragged him from his mother's bedroom.
Go find him, speak gently, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I beg you, hurry.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends, And let them know both what we mean to do And what's done at an unfortunate time.
so maybe slander, whose whisper covers the entire world As surely as the cannon hits its target and Delivers his poisoned shot, may miss our name, And not amount to anything at all.
My soul is full of confusion and sorrow. 
Safely hidden.
Hamlet!
Lord Hamlet!
What’s that noise?
Who calls Hamlet?
Here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Mixed it with dust, to which it is related.
Tell us where it is, that we may take it from there, And carry it to the chapel.
Don’t believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your advice, and not my own.
You take me for a sponge, my lord?
Yes, sir, that soaks up the King's face, his rewards, his authorities.
But such officers do the king best service in the end.
He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first to be tasted, and then at last swallowed.
When he needs what you have found out, it is by squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
I don’t understand you, my lord.
I am glad of it.
A clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king.
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
The king is a thing, A thing, my lord!
Of nothing.
Bring me to him.
Hide, fox, and show all later. 
I have sent to find him and the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet we must not put the strong law on him.
He's very popular with this country’s masses, Who like not in their minds, but with their eyes, And where it is so, the offender's punishment is important, but never the offense.
To deal with everything smoothly and evenly, this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event.
Diseases grown desperate are best healed by desperate measures, Or not at all.
We cannot get from him Where the dead body is hidden, my lord.
But where is he?
Outside, my lord, guarded, to know what you want.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper.
At supper!
Where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
A certain group of educated worms are now biting him.
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
We fatten up all other creatures to fatten us up, when we fatten ourselves for maggots.
Your fat king and your lean beggar interchangeable, two dishes but for one table.
That's the end.
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king, and eat the fish that has fed on that worm.
What do you mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send there to see.
If your messenger can’t find him there, look for him in the other place yourself.
But, indeed, if you don’t find him within this month, you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
Go find him there.
He will stay until you come.
Hamlet, for this deed, for your special safety, Which we do consider as we dearly grieve For what you’ve done, we must send you away With fiery quickness.
For England!
Yes, Hamlet.
Good.
So it is, if you knew our reasons.
I see an angel that sees them.
But, come, for England!
Goodbye, dear mother.
Your loving father, Hamlet.
My mother.
Father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.
Come, for England!
I’ll have him away tonight.
Away!
because everything is sealed and done That relies on this affair.
I beg you, hurry.
And, England, if you hold my love at anything, As my great power may give you some sense, Since your scar still looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and your open fear Pays homage to us, you might not view Our sovereign process coldly, which gives you full power, By letters testifying to that effect, The present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England, Because, he rages like the pace of my blood, And you must cure me.
Until I know it is done, However great my luck, my joys can never begin. 
Go, Captain, send my greetings to the Danish king.
Tell him that, with his permission, Fortinbras Desires to carry out a promised march Over his kingdom.
You know the meeting place.
If his majesty has anything for us to do, We shall express our duty in person, And let him know so.
I will do it, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose armies are these?
They are from Norway, sir.
For what purpose, sir, I beg you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Does it go against the main part of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
To speak honestly, and with no addition to the facts, We go to gain a little patch of ground That’s not worth anything except its name.
To pay five dollars, five, I wouldn’t farm it, And it won’t yield either to Norway or the Poles A worse rate if it should it be sold in payment.
Why, then the Poles never will defend it.
Yes, it already has garrisons.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars Will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land.
This is the abscess of much wealth and peace, That breaks inward, and shows no damage until The man dies.
I humbly thank you, sir.
God be with you, sir.
Will you please go, my lord?
I’ll be with you right away.
Walk a little before me.
How every event works against me To spur my dull revenge!
What is a man, If his chief good and use of his time Is only to sleep and eat?
A beast, no more.
Surely He that made us with such large capacity, Looking before and after, didn’t give us That capability and godlike reason To go stale in us, unused.
Now, where it is Beastly forgetfulness, or some defeated principle Of thinking too much on the event, A thought which, cut in quarters, has but one part wisdom And always three parts coward, I don’t know Why I am still live to say “This thing's to do, “ Since I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do it.
Examples, as obvious as dirt, urge me.
Look at this army, of such size and power, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit, with divine ambition puffed up, Makes faces at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that luck, death, and danger dare to do, Even for an eggshell.
Rightly to be great Is not to move without great argument, But to find quarrel greatly in worthless land When honor’s at stake.
How do I stand, then, That have a father killed, a mother stained, Aggravation of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That, for a whim and trick of fame, Go to their graves like going to bed, fight for a plot On which the numbers don’t have room to fight for the Cause, which is not tomb enough and big enough To hide the slain?
O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be worth nothing! 
I will not speak with her.
She is unfortunate, indeed deranged.
Her mood must be pitied.
What does she need?
She speaks a lot about her father, she says she hears There are tricks in the world, and coughs, and beats her chest, Kicks enviously at nothing, says things in doubt That only make half sense.
her speech is nothing, Yet the random use of it moves The listeners to collect them, they aim at making sense of It, and mix her words up fit to their own ideas, Which, as her winks and nods and gestures as she Speaks, would indeed make someone think there might Be clear, though nothing for sure, yet very unhappily.
It would be good she were spoken with, because she May scatter dangerous ideas in rude minds.
Let her come in.
To my sick soul, such as sin's true nature is, Each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm.
Guilt is so full of artless jealousy, that It spills itself in fearing to be spilled.
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
How should I know your true love From another one?
By his whimsical bat and his staff And his sandal shoes.
Alas, sweet lady, what does this song mean?
What did you say?
No, I beg you, listen.
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone, At his head a grass green turf, At his heels a stone.
No, but Ophelia I beg you, listen.
His shroud is as white as the mountain snow, Alas, look here, my lord!
All covered with sweet flowers, Which drowned in tears went to the grave With showers of true love.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God protect you!
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but don’t know what we may be.
God be at your table!
Thinking on her father.
Then up he rose and put on his clothes, And opened the chamber door, Let in the maid that rejected a maid and Never left again.
Pretty Ophelia!
Indeed, la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on it.
By God and by Saint Charity, Pity, and for shame, for shame!
Young men will do it if they come to it, By God, they are to blame.
How long has she been like this?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient.
but I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him in the cold ground.
My brother shall know of it.
and so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach!
Follow her closely, watch her well, I beg you.
O, this is the poison of deep grief, it all springs From her father's death.
O my dear Gertrude, this worry, Compared to a murdering piece, gives me more than Enough death in many places.
For pity’s sake, what’s this noise?
Where are my Swiss guards?
Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?
Save yourself, my lord.
The ocean, exceeding of his borders, Doesn’t eat the flatlands with more impatient speed Than young Laertes, heading a riot, Takes over your offices.
The crowd calls him lord, And, as the world were just beginning now, Old history forgotten, customs not known, They certify and prop up every word, They cry “We choose!
O, this is rebellion, you false Danish dogs!
The doors are broken.
Where is this king?
Sirs, you all wait outside.
No, let's come in.
I beg you, leave me alone.
We will, we will.
I thank you.
Guard the door.
O you vile king, Give me my father!
Calmly, good Laertes.
That drop of blood that's in control says I’m a bastard, Cries my father’s wife was unfaithful, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unmarked brows Of my true mother.
What is the cause, Laertes, That your rebellion looks so huge?
There's such divinity that surrounds a king, That treason can only peep to what it would do, Acts little by his will.
Tell me, Laertes, Why are you so angry like this?
Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
Where is my father?
Dead.
But he didn’t do it.
Why is he dead?
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the deepest pit!
I dare damnation.
Who shall prevent you from it?
My will alone, nothing else in the world.
And I’ll use my methods so well, That they shall go far with little effort.
Good Laertes, If you desire to know the circumstances Of your dear father's death, is it written in your revenge That, in the gambling, you will draw both friend and foe, winner and loser?
No one but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
I’ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends, And, like the pelican of the old fables, Feed them with my own blood.
Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman.
It shall penetrate your understanding That I am innocent of your father's death, And am most sincerely in grief for it, As day penetrates your eye.
Let her come in.
How now!
What’s that noise?
O heat, dry up my brains!
Tears with seven times the Salt, burn out the sight and truth of my eyes!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens!
Is it possible a young maid's sanity Should be die as does an old man?
Nature is short in love, and where it is short, It sends some precious moment of itself Close to the thing it loves.
They bore him barefaced on the bier Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny And on his grave rained many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
Had you your sanity, and you persuaded me to revenge, It couldn’t move like this.
It is the false servant, that stole his master's daughter.
This “nothing” is more than just a story.
There's fennel for you, and columbines.
there's rue for you, and here's some for me.
There's a daisy.
I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead, Go to your death-bed, He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow, All white was his hair.
He is gone, he is gone, And we go away crying.
God have mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.
God be with you.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must share your grief, Or you deny me my rights.
Step aside, Choose whichever of your wisest friends you want, And they shall hear and judge between you and me.
If they find that we killed your father or had him killed, We will surrender our kingdom, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction, but if not, You must be patient with us, And we shall work together with your soul To give it just compensation.
I agree, His means of death, his obscure burial, No trophy, sword, no coat of arms over his bones No noble rites or state funeral, Cry to be heard, from heaven to earth as it were, That I must call it into question.
And so you shall, And wherever the guilt is, that’s where the punishment will be.
I beg you, go with me. 
Who wants to speak with me?
Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them in.
I don’t know from what part of the world I should be contacted, if not by Lord Hamlet.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless you too.
He shall, sir, if it pleases him.
Horatio, when you read this, give these fellows some way to talk to the king.
They have letters for him.
Before we were even at sea for two days, a very nasty looking pirate chased us.
Finding ourselves sailing too slow, we put up a great fight, and, in the skirmish, I boarded them.
Just then, they sailed away from our ship, so only I became their prisoner.
Let the king have the letters I have sent, and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death.
I have words to speak into your ear will make you speechless, but are they much too light for the heart of the matter.
These good fellows will bring you to where I am.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are still going to England.
I have much to tell you about them.
Goodbye.
He that you knows you, HAMLET.
Then you can direct me To him you delivered them for. 
Now you must see that I am not guilty, And you must put me in your heart as a friend, Since you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That man who killed your noble father Wanted to kill me.
It seems to be the truth.
but tell me Why didn’t you take action against these things, So full of crime and punishable by death, As you mainly were upset By concern for your safety, wisdom, if nothing else.
O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem a bit cowardly, But yet to me they are strong.
The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks, and for myself, Whether it’s my virtue or my plague, She's so necessary to my life and soul, That, as the star moves only in his orbit, I couldn’t do anything without her say-so.
The other motive, why I couldn’t go to a public court, Is the great love the people of this country have for him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turn wood to stone, Convert his crimes to graces, so that my actions, Not at all popular with the masses, Would have reflected badly on me, And not be taken as I intended them.
And so I have lost a noble father, A sister driven into insanity, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood as a challenger to the most beautiful woman of all Time for her perfections.
but my revenge will come.
Don’t lose any sleep over it.
You mustn’t think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our power be shaken with danger, And think it unimportant.
You will soon hear more.
What news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This one to your majesty, this one to the queen.
From Hamlet!
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say, I didn’t see them.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us alone.
High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
What does this mean?
Are all the rest returning?
Or is it some trick and no such thing?
Do you recognize the writing?
It’s Hamlet's handwriting.
I have no idea, my lord.
But let him come.
How can it be otherwise?
Yes, my lord, Just as long as you don’t ask me to forget about it.
Only to your own satisfaction.
It’s falling into place.
You have been talked about since your travel so much, For a quality where, they say, you really shine.
All your parts together Didn’t arouse such jealousy in him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Is his weak spot.
What part is that, my lord?
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, But necessary too, for youth doesn’t look less well in The fun and reckless clothes that it wears Than old age settles for his black furs and woolens, Showing health and seriousness.
Two months ago, There was a gentleman from Normandy here, I’ve seen myself, and served against the French, And they can do well on horseback, but this gallant Had witchcraft in it.
He grew into his seat, And had his horse do such wonderful things, As if he had been absorbed into the horse’s body With the brave beast.
He so impressed me, That I, through lies and tricks, Didn’t waste time in finding out what he did.
A Norman, was it?
A Norman.
I swear, Lamond.
The very same.
I know him well.
He is the jewel, indeed, And gem of the whole nation.
Sir, this report of his Poisoned Hamlet with envy That he couldn’t do anything but wish and beg Your sudden coming over her to play with him.
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Not that I think you didn’t love your father, But because I know love is begun by time, And I see, in the ways of love, That time dampens the spark and fire of it.
Within the very flame of love, there lives A kind of wick or snuff that will put it out, And nothing is worse than goodness staying still, For goodness, growing to an infectious flu, Dies in his own too much.
What we want to do, We should do when we would, for this 'would' changes, And has stoppages and delays as many As there are voices, hands, accidents, And then this 'should' is like the sigh of a spendthrift, That hurts by easing up.
But to the heart of the matter.
Hamlet comes back.
What would you do To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words?
To cut his throat in the church.
Murder, indeed, should not be a church activity, because Then revenge should have no bounds.
When Hamlet returns, he shall know you’re Home.
We'll start rumors that praise your excellence And exaggerate the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you together in the end, And place bets on your fight.
He, being weak, Most generous, and free from all trickery, Will not think about swords, so that easily, Or with a little mix up, you may choose A sword that’s not poisoned, and, in a pass during Practice, kill him in revenge for your father.
I’ll do it.
And for that purpose, I’ll poison my sword.
I bought an oil of a mountebank, So mortal that, only dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood, no super-potion so rare, Collected from all antidotes under the moon That have always worked, can save the thing from death And this is only with a scratch.
I’ll touch the point of my sword with this poison so that, if I touch him slightly, It will kill him.
Therefore this project should have a plan B or C, that might hold if this first one failed.
Hang on!
Let me think.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, I have it!
While you’re moving around and you are hot and dry, Since you’ll make your bouts more violent to that purpose, and he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared a Goblet for him for that purpose, so that even only sipping, If he escapes your stick of venom by luck, We can be successful this way.
What now, sweet queen!
One sorrow walks on the heels of another, Following too fast.
Your sister's drowned, Laertes.
Drowned!
O, where?
Alas, then she is drowned?
Drowned, drowned.
You had too much water, poor Ophelia, And therefore I’ll hold back my tears, but It is still our trick, nature holds her habits, Let shame say what it will.
When these tears are gone, Woman will be extinct.
Farewell, my lord.
I have a rumor of fire, that I would gladly spread, Before this news puts the fire out.
Let's follow him, Gertrude,.
I had all I could do to calm his anger!
Now I fear this will make it start all over again, Therefore let's follow him. 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell you she is, and therefore make her grave straight.
The coroner has decided, and finds it Christian burial.
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?
Why, that’s the coroner’s finding.
It must be self-offense.
It can’t be anything else.
Here lies the water, good.
Here stands the man, good.
But is this law?
Yes, by Mary, it’s the coroner’s inquest law.
Will you know the truth about it?
If this hadn’t been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried without a Christian burial.
Why, there you’ve said it.
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than another Christian.
Come, my spade.
There are no old gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They hold up Adam's profession.
Was he a gentleman?
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Why, he had none.
What, are you a pagan?
How do you understand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another question to you.
The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
I like your joke, I swear.
Do it again, come on.
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?
Yes, tell me that, and stop my guessing.
By Mary, now I can tell.
Do it.
Mass, I cannot tell.
Go, get you to Johann, bring me a mug of whiskey.
In youth when I did love, did love, I thought it was very sweet, To contract, O, the time for, ah, my reason, O, I thought there was nothing meet.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-digging?
Habit has made it a property of easiness in him.
That’s true.
The one that doesn’t work has the more delicate sense.
But age, with his stealing steps, Has clawed me in his clutch, And has shipped me until the land, As if I had never been such.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.
How the man jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!
This might be the head of a politician, which this ass now reaches over one that would go around God, might it not?
It might, my lord.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How are you, good lord?
This might be my lord so-and-so, that praised my lord such-and-such's horse when he meant to ask for it, might it not?
Yes, my lord.
Why, even so.
and now my Lady Worm's, no jaw and knocked about the face with a sexton's spade.
Here's fine turnaround, if we were able to see it.
Did these bones cost no more the making of them but to play at games with them?
Mine ache to think about it.
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet, Oe a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is ptoper.
There's another.
why can’t that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where are his arguments now, his pens, his cases, his subpoenas, and his tricks?
Why does he allow this rude fellow to knock him about the head now, with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him why he’s being hit?
Hum!
This fellow might have been a great buyer of land in his time, with his statutes, his emblems, his fine art, his double billing, his house seizures?
Is this the finest of his fine art, and the seizure of his house seizures, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt?
Will his billing bill him no more for his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens?
The very transfers of his lands will scarcely lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, huh?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Isn’t parchment made of sheep-skins?
Yes, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.
I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave is this, sir?
Mine, sir.
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
I think it’s yours indeed, for you lie in it.
You lie out of it, sir, and therefore it’s not yours.
For my part, I don’t lie in it, yet it ‘s mine.
You do lie in it, to be in it and say it is yours.
It is for the dead, not for the quick, therefore you lie.
It is a quick lie, sir, it will go away again from me to you.
What man dot you dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman then?
For none neither.
Who is to be buried in it?
One that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolutely clever this chap is!
We must speak by the book or lying will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he hurts his feelings.
How long have you been a grave-maker?
Of all the days in the year, I became a grave-maker the day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Can’t you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born, he that is crazy and sent into England.
Yes, by Mary, why was he sent to England?
He shall get his mind back there, or, if he doesn’t, it's no great problem there.
Why?
It will not be seen in him there.
There the men are as crazy as he is.
How did he become crazy?
Very strangely, they say.
How strangely?
Actually, even by losing his mind.
On what grounds?
Why, here in Denmark.
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie in the earth before he rots?
Well, if he’s not rotten before he dies, as we have many small pox corpses nowadays that will scarce last beyond the wake, he will last you some eight years or nine years.
A tanner will last you nine years.
Why he more than another?
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body.
Here's a skull now.
This skull has been buried three-and-twenty years.
Whose was it?
A bastard, crazy fellow's it was.
Whose do you think it was?
No, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a crazy rogue!
He poured a pint of Rhine wine on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
This one?
Just that one.
Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite fun, of most excellent imagination.
I want to vomit.
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I don’t know how many times.
Where are your jokes now?
Your games?
Your songs?
Your flashes of laughter that always make the audience roar?
No one now, to mock your own grinning?
Quite jaw-fallen?
I beg you, Horatio, tell me one thing.
What's that, my lord?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this in the earth?
Yuck!
Just like that, my lord.
What common uses we may return to, Horatio!
Why can’t imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander until he finds it stopping a wine barrel?
It’s thinking about it too much to think like that.
Emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
O, that the earth which kept the world in fear Should patch a wall to expel the winter's cold!
But quiet!
Who is that they’re following?
And with such shortened rites?
This shows that The corpse they follow did, with a desperate hand, Commit suicide.
It was of some nobility.
Let’s hide and listen.
What other ceremony?
That is Laertes, A very noble youth.
Look.
What other ceremony?
Her funeral rites have been as far enlarged As we can enlarge.
Isn’t there more be done?
Lay her in the earth, And may violets spring from her fair And unpolluted flesh!
I tell you, churlish priest, My sister shall be a ministering angel When you lie howling.
What, the fair Ophelia?
Sweets to the sweet.
farewell.
I hoped you would have been my Hamlet's wife, I thought to have decorated your bride-bed, sweet maid, And not your grave.
O, three times sorrow Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed deprived you of your most wonderful Intelligence!
Stop the burial a while, Until I hold her once more in mine arms.
Now bury the living and dead, Until you have made a mountain from this flat earth To be higher than the mountain of Italy or the skyish head Of blue Mount Olympus.
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take your soul!
You don’t pray well.
I beg you, take your fingers from my throat, For, although I am not impatient and rash, I still have something dangerous in me, Which you should fear.
Take away your hand!
Separate them.
Gentlemen!
My good lord, be quiet.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer blink.
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia!
Forty thousand brothers Couldn’t, even with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.
What will you do for her?
O, he is crazy, Laertes.
For love of God, leave him alone!
God’s wounds, show me what you'll do.
I’ll do it.
Be buried quickly with her, and so will I.
And, if you babble about mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, until our ground, Singeing his head against the burning sun, Make the highest mountain like a wart!
No, if you’ll Speak, I’ll rant as well as you.
Eventually, as patient as the female dove When that her golden twins are discovered, His silence will sit drooping.
I always loved you.
But it’s not important.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and every dog will have his day.
Good Gertrude, put a guard over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument.
So much for this, sir.
Now as for the other thing, You do remember all the circumstances?
Remember it, my lord!
Sir, there was a kind of fighting in my heart That wouldn’t let me sleep.
I thought I lay Worse than in a rebellion, in the chains.
such ghosts and goblins in my life, That, on my arrival, without any delay, No, not even to wait for the grinding of the axe, My head should be chopped off.
Is it possible?
But will you listen to how I proceeded?
Go ahead..
Being surrounded like this with evil plans, Before I could start thinking about it, before They could execute the plan, I sat myself down, Though up a new order, wrote it just like the original.
I used to think, as our politicians do, A sin to make a forgery and worked hard at How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me a useful service.
Do you want to know The effect of what I wrote?
Yes, good my lord.
An earnest oath from the king, As England was his faithful ally, As love between them might flourish like the palm tree, As peace should still wear her wheaten garland And stand like a comma between their friendships, And many “as-es” like that of great emotion, That, on the view and knowledge of these contents, Without further discussion, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not even allowing time for confession and penance.
How was this sealed?
Why, even in that was heaven good to me.
Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, and what followed You know already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to it.
Why, man, they did make love to this job.
Their defeat Grew by their own actions.
It is dangerous when the lower nature comes Between the ups and downs Of mighty opposites.
Why, what a king is this!
Doesn’t it, do you thank, become my responsibility to kill He that has killed my king, and whored my mother, Push himself in between the election and my hope to be King, tried to kill me, And with such knowledge, isn’t it perfect duty To kill him with this arm?
and isn’t it to be damned To let this canker of our nature do Further evil?
The time between is mine, And a man's life is longer than it takes to say “One.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That I forgot myself to Laertes, Because, by the image of my cause, I can see Myself in him.
I’ll court his favors.
But, for sure, the bravery of his grief put me Into a towering passion.
Quiet, who’s coming here?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Do you know this water-fly?
No, my good lord.
Your state is the more gracious, for it is a vice to know him.
He has much fertile land.
Let a beast be lord of beasts, and his cattle shall stand at the king's dinner table.
He’s a clown, but, as I say, proud to own dirt.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were not busy, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
I will listen very carefully.
Put your hat to its right use.
It is for the head.
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
No, believe me, it is very cold, the wind is northerly.
It is unusually cold, my lord, indeed.
I think it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry, I can’t tell how.
But, my lord, his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head.
Sir, here Laertes is newly come to court, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent traits, of very soft manners and looking great.
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, because you shall find in him the continent of what a gentleman is.
Sir, his refinement suffers no lie from you, although, I know, to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic, and yet not off course, in regard to his quick sail.
But, in the truth of praise, I take him to be a soul of great note, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true talk of him, he is what you see, and whoever copies him, is his shadow, nothing more.
Your lordship speaks most truly of him.
The concern sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath?
Sir?
Isn’t it possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do it, Sir, really.
What about the naming of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
Of him, sir.
Well, sir.
I mean, sir, for his weapon, but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his skill, he has no equal.
What's his weapon?
Sword and dagger.
That's two of his weapons.
but never mind.
What do you call the carriages?
I knew you must be aware of the margin before you had finished.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
But, on.
Why is this all wagered, as you call it?
What if I say no?
I mean, my lord, the fight of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.
If it please his majesty, it is the relaxing time of day with me.
Shall I re-deliver your answer like that?
With my meaning, sir, however you want to say it.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
He does well to praise himself, because no one else will praise him.
A just hatched bird runs away with eggshell on his head.
He did comply with his mother’s breast before he sucked it.
He has, and many more just like him that I know the worthless age dotes on, are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style, a kind of swollen collection, which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst.
My lord, his majesty sent a message to you by young Osric, who tells him that you will meet him in the hall.
He want to know if will play with Laertes now, or whether you will take a longer time.
I am true to my intentions; they follow the king's pleasure.
If he is ready now, I am too, now or whenever, provided that I am so able as I am now.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you start to play.
She instructs me well.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I don’t think so.
Since he went to France, I have been in constant practice.
I shall win at the odds.
But you wouldn’t know what a bad feeling I have inside.
But it doesn’t matter.
No, my good lord, It’s only foolishness, but it is such a kind of misgiving as would maybe trouble a woman.
If you have a gut feeling, obey it.
Being ready is everything.
Since no man has anything of what he leaves, what is it to leave soon?
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give me your pardon, sir.
This King knows, and you must have heard, How I am punished with a painful madness.
What I have done That might deeply hurt your nature, honor, And complaints, I here proclaim was craziness.
Was it Hamlet who wronged Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
Who does it, then?
His madness.
Sir, before this audience, Let my denial of evil intent Give me immunity in your most generous thoughts As though I have shot my arrow over the house And hurt my brother.
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should move me the most To my revenge.
But in my terms of honor I hold back, and will make no reconciliation Until, by some elder masters of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name unbloody.
But until that time, I receive your offered love like love, And won’t do it wrong.
I accept it freely, And will play this brother's wager honestly.
Give us the swords, come on.
Come, one for me.
I’ll be your mirror, Laertes.
In my ignorance, Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night, be shown to its fiery advantage indeed.
You mock me, sir.
No, honestly.
Give them the swords, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
I have seen you both, But since he's gotten better, we have, therefore, odds.
I like this one.
All these swords have a length?
Yes, my good lord.
Set up the goblets of wine for me on that table.
If Hamlet gives the first or second hit, Or quits in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements fire their ammunition, The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, And in the cup he shall throw a pearl, Richer than that which four successive kings Have worn in Denmark's crown.
Give me the cups, And let the kettle drum speak to the trumpet, The trumpet to the cannon man outside, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin.
And you, the judges, watch carefully.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judges?
A hit, a hit that was felt.
OK, again.
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is your, Here's to your health.
Give him the cup.
I’ll play this bout first, put it aside a while.
Come on.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.
He's fat, and out of breath.
The queen drinks to your fortune, Hamlet.
Good madam!
Gertrude, don’t drink.
I will, my lord, I beg you to pardon me.
It is the poisoned cup; it is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam, by and by.
Come, let me wipe your face.
My lord, I’ll hit him now.
I don’t think so.
And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Come, for the third, Laertes.
You say so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
I’ll attack you now!
Part them.
They are in a rage.
Look to the queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides.
How are you, my lord?
How are you, Laertes?
Why, as a woodpecker caught in my own trap, Osric.
I am justly killed with my own wickedness.
How is the Queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.
No, no!
I am poisoned.
O villainy!
Ho!
Let the doors be locked.
Wickedness!
Find it!
It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, you are killed, No medicine in the world can save you.
The evil deed Has turned itself on me.
Behold, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Your mother's poisoned.
I can do no more.
The King, the King's to blame.
The point poisoned too!
Then, venom, do your work.
Treason!
Treason!
O, still defend me, friends!
I am only hurt.
Here, you incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink this potion.
Is your marriage here?
Follow my mother.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
And I am not guilty of yours.
Heaven forgive you for it!
I follow you.
I am dead, Horatio.
Wretched queen, goodbye!
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Here's some poison wine still left.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name that is, Things left unknown like this, shall live after me!
If you ever did hold me in your heart, Stay away from happy things for a while, And, in this harsh world, draw your breath in pain To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
Young Fortinbras, after conquering Poland, Gives this warlike volley To the ambassadors of England.
I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do predict that the throne belongs To Fortinbras.
Now a noble heart breaks.
Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing you to your rest!
Why does the drum come here?
Where is this sight?
What do you want to see?
If anything of sorrow or wonder, stop your search.
This scene is chaotic.
O proud death, What feast is being held in your eternal cell, That you have killed so many princes So bloodily all at the same time?
The sight is sad, And our affairs come too late from England.
The ears that should give us hearing can’t hear, To tell him his order is obeyed, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Who will thank us?
No thanks from his mouth, If it were alive to thank you.
He never gave orders for their deaths.
But since, you from the Polack wars, and you from England, are here arrived, and so jump on this bloody Question, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about.
So you shall hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths planned by cunning and false causes, And, in this result, mistaken motives Fallen on the planners' heads.
I can truly deliver All this.
Let us hurry to hear it, And call the noblest to hear it too.
As for me, I embrace my fortune with sorrow.
I have some rights of past history in this kingdom, Which now invites me to claim my place.
I shall also have cause to speak of that, And directly from his mouth whose voice will deliver it.
But let this speaking be done now, Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the platform, For he was likely, had he been King, To have proved most royal, and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war will Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies.
