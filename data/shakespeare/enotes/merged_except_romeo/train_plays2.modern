Who's there?
No, answer me.
Halt, and identify yourself.
Long live the king!
Bernardo?
Yes.
You’re really on time.
It’s just midnight.
Go to bed, Francisco.
Thanks for being on time.
It’s bitter cold, And I’m depressed.
Have things been quiet on your watch?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
If you meet Horatio and Marcellus, The ones who will watch with me, tell them to hurry up.
I think I hear them.
Halt!
Who goes there?
Your friends.
And subjects of the Dane.
Have a good night.
Bernardo.
Have a good-night.
What, is that Horatio with you?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, good Marcellus.
Tell me, has this thing appeared again tonight?
I haven’t seen anything.
Horatio says it’s all in our imagination, And doesn’t believe a word we say About this dreaded sight, seen twice by us.
So I’ve begged him to come along With us to watch what happens this night, That, if this apparition comes again, He may believe what we have seen and speak to it.
Nonsense, nonsense, it will not appear.
Sit down awhile, And let us tell you once again, You who is so stubborn in not believing our story, What we have seen these last two nights.
OK, let’s sit down, And listen to Bernardo speak of this.
Last night, When that star up there, that's west of the North Pole, Had moved around to light that part of the sky Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The clock’s bell then tolling one, Quiet, stop!
Look it’s coming again!
It looks just like the dead king!
You’re a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.
Doesn’t it look like the King?
Look at it, Horatio.
Yes, it does.
It fills me with fear and wonder.
It wants to be spoken to.
Question it, Horatio.
What are you, that seizes this time of night, Taking the same fair and warlike form In which the dead king of Denmark, now buried, Did sometimes march?
By heaven I order you, speak!
It is offended.
See, it stalks away!
Stay!
speak, speak!
I order you to speak!
It is gone, and will not answer us.
What’s wrong, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.
Is this not more than our imaginations?
What do you think about it?
Before my God, I might not believe this thing Without the seeing and true testimony Of my own eyes.
Isn’t it like the King?
As you are to yourself.
It is strange.
It’s come twice before, and just appearing out of nothing, he’s gone past us at this dead hour with a warlike stalk.
I don’t know what its intentions are, But, in the plainness and freedom of my opinion, This foretells some strange eruption to our state.
Who is the man who can explain this to me?
I can explain it, At least, what’s on the grapevine.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
Well it may turn out that this warning figure Comes armed through our watch, looking so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.
It is a speck of dust to irritate the mind's eye.
In the most high and palm tree-like state of Rome, A little before the mightiest Julius Caesar was killed, The graves had no bodies, and the dead in sheets Squeaked and gibbered in the Roman streets, And stars with trains of fire and red morning dews, Disasters in the sun.
And like similar forecasters of fierce events, As the advance team before the fates, And prologue to the omen coming on, Heaven and earth have together demonstrated To our country and countrymen.
Look where it comes again!
I’ll cross it, though it kill me.
Stay, illusion!
stay, and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus!
Shall I strike at it with my club?
Go ahead, if it will not stand.
It is here!
It is here!
It is gone!
We do it wrong, its being so like the king, To offer it the show of violence, Because it is, like the air, unable to be hurt, And our empty blows seem like a malicious joke.
It was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.
And then it seemed startled, like a guilty thing Running from a court order.
I have heard The rooster, that is the trumpet of the morning, With his lofty and shrill-sounding throat, Awakes the god of day, and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The straying and wandering spirit hurries back To his grave.
It faded on the crowing of the rooster.
I’ve heard that too, and partly believe it.
But, look, the morning, dressed in a red cape, Walks over the dew of that high hill in the east.
Let’s break up our watch, and I think We should tell all we have seen tonight To young Hamlet, for, I swear on my life, This spirit, silent to us, will speak to him.
Do you agree that we shall tell him, Because we love him and it is our duty?
Let's do it, I beg you, and I know exactly Where we shall easily find him. 
We have not disregarded Your good advice, which has freely gone Along with this affair.
To all, our thanks.
I will tell you now, as you know, young Fortinbras, Not thinking very much of us, Or thinking that our late dear brother's death Made our country disorganized and no longer powerful, Conspiring with this dream of his advantage, Has not failed to pester us with messages, Asking us to the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, within all the rules of law, To our most valiant brother.
So much for him!
Now what we have done so far Is this.
we have here written To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, knows nothing Of his nephew's intentions, to stop His further progress in this plan because the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Without his knowledge, and we are sending You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, To take this greeting to old Norway, Without giving you any further personal power To do business with the king, more than the scope Of these detailed items allow.
Farewell and hurry to do your duty.
In that and all things, we will show our duty.
We do not doubt it.
Heartily, farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us you want something.
What is it, Laertes?
You cannot start to ask the King of Denmark, And then stop.
What do you want, Laertes, That I shall not my offer before you ask?
The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to your father.
What would you ask, Laertes?
Have you your father's permission?
What says Polonius?
My lord, he has wrung from me my reluctant permission By asking me again and again, and I Finally had to give in.
I do beg you, give him permission to go.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
That’s not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.
Good Hamlet, take off your black looks, And let your eye look on the King like a friend.
Don’t look for your noble father on the ground Forever with sad eyes.
Yes, madam, that’s the way it goes.
If that’s the way it goes, Why does it seem unusual with you?
Seem?”, madam!
No, it is.
For shame!
It is a sin to heaven, A sin against the dead, a sin to nature, Most ridiculous to reason, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still has cried, From the first corpse to the man who died just today, ”This must be so.” We beg you, give up on This unusual grief, and think of us As of a father.
Because, let the whole world know, You are the next in line to our throne, And, I give you my love, with no less nobility Than the love which the dearest father Bears his son.
As for your intentions To go back to school in Wittenberg, Leaving here is not something that we want, And we beg you to give into remaining Here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes, Our most important courtier, cousin, and our son.
Don’t let my prayers go unanswered, Hamlet.
I beg you to stay with us, don’t go to Wittenberg.
I’ll do my best to obey you, madam.
Why, it is a loving and a fair reply.
Behave as we would in Denmark.
Let’s go.
O God!
O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable All the habits of this world seem to me!
Shame on it!
O for shame!
It is an unweeded garden That is going to seed, only things that are decaying and Disgusting grow there.
That it should come to this!
Only dead for two months!
Heaven and earth!
Must I remember?
Weakness, your name is woman — A little month, even before those shoes with which she Followed my poor father's body were old, she was Totally inconsolable, all tears, why she, even she— O God!
a beast that lacks the gift of reason, Would have mourned longer— married my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I am like Hercules.
Within a month, Before the salt of the most wicked tears Had left the redness in her bitter eyes, She married.
O, most wicked speed, to travel With such quickness to incestuous sheets!
It is not good and it cannot come to good.
But, break my heart, for I must be silent!
Greetings to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well.
Or I do forget myself!
It’s me, my lord, and your poor servant forever.
And why are you here from Wittenberg, Horatio?
A lazy disposition, my good lord.
I wouldn’t even hear your enemy say so, And you shall not violently throw those words to my ear, To make my ear the keeper of your own report Against yourself.
I know you are not lazy.
But what are you doing in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink a lot before you leave!
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Please don’t mock me, fellow-student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Indeed, my lord, it followed very soon after.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!
The meats baked for the funeral Were also put on the marriage tables.
I wish I had met my dearest enemy in heaven Before I had ever seen that day, Horatio!
My father… I think I see my father.
Where, my lord?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.
My lord, I think I saw him last night.
My lord, the king your father.
The King my father!
Hold off your compliments for awhile And pay attention, until I may deliver, With the witness of these gentlemen, Something marvelous to you.
For God's love, let me hear what you have to say.
But where was this?
My lord, on the platform where we watched.
Didn’t you speak to it?
My lord, I did, But it made me no answer.
It is very strange.
I swear, my honored lord, it is true, And we thought it was our duty To let you know about it.
Are you going to watch again tonight?
We are, my lord.
He was armed, you say?
Armed, my lord.
From top to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then you didn’t see his face?
O, yes, my lord.
He had the front visor of his helmet up.
What, did he look like he was frowning?
His face showed more sorrow than anger.
Was he pale or red?
No, very pale.
And he fixed his eyes on you?
Most constantly.
I wish I had been there.
It would have amazed you very much.
I’m sure it would’ve, I’m sure it would’ve.
Did it stay long?
As long as an average person might count to a hundred.
Longer, longer.
Not when I saw it.
His beard was grizzly, no?
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A silvery sable.
I guarantee it will.
If it takes on my noble father's appearance, I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should open wide And order me to be silent.
I beg you all, If you have kept this sight secret so far, Keep your silence still, And whatever else shall happen tonight, Take it in, but don’t talk about it.
I will reward your loyalty.
So, goodbye for now.
On the platform, between eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.
Our duty to your honor.
Your loyalty, as mine to you.
Goodbye.
My father's spirit in arms!
I wish the night were here now!
Until then, sit still, my soul.
Wicked deeds will rise to be Seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth. 
The things I need are all on the ship.
Goodbye.
And, sister, as the winds will be favorable And the ships are strong to sail, don’t sleep, Until you let me hear from you.
Do you doubt that?
As for Hamlet and the foolishness of his attentions, Think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood.
Nothing more than that?
Stop thinking about it, Because nature, the moon, does not grow alone In strength and size, but as this temple grows, The inward duty of the mind and soul Grows wide along with the rest.
He may not, as lower persons do, Select for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be subject To the voice and consent of that state That he is the head of.
Then if he says he loves you, You would be wise to believe it Because then being in his particular act and place May do what he says, which is what The majority of people in of Denmark go along with.
So decide what loss your honor may receive If you listen to his songs with a too believing ear, Or lose your heart, or lose your virginity To his wild sense of bad timing.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep your affections deep within you, Out of the range and danger of desire.
The most careful maid is wasteful enough If she unmasks her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself doesn’t aim at lying deeds.
An ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring Too often before they have bloomed, And in the morning and liquid dew of youth Contagious shriveling is the most imminent.
Youth rebels against itself, even if no one else is near.
I shall keep the purpose of this good lesson As watchman to my heart.
But, my good brother, Don’t, as some insincere ministers do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, While, like a proud and reckless wild man, Preaches against the primrose path of sin And does not practice what he preaches.
O, don’t be afraid of me.
I’ve stayed too long.
But here comes my father.
A double blessing is a double grace, It’s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again.
You’re still here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the best part of your sail, And the ship waits for you.
There, my blessing with you!
And see that you write these few precepts In your memory.
Give your thoughts to yourself, And don’t act without thinking.
Be friendly, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends you have, and their friendship tested, Anchor them to your soul with hoops of steel, But don’t spend your money on entertaining Each newly acquired, unproven friend.
Beware Of getting into a quarrel, but, once you are in, Fight so that the man you fight with may beware of you.
This above all, to your own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, You cannot then be false to any man.
Goodbye.
My blessing instill these things in you!
I take my leave most humbly, my lord.
Goodbye, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
It is locked in my memory, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Goodbye.
What is it, Ophelia, that he has said to you?
If it pleases you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
By Mary, well thought.
What is going on between you?
Tell me the truth.
My lord, he has of late made many offers Of his affection to me.
Affection!
Pooh!
You speak like a green girl, Ignorant in such dangerous circumstances.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
My lord, I don’t know what I should think.
By Mary, I’ll teach you.
Think that you are a baby, That you have taken these offers for true love, Which are not true offers.
Consider yourself more dearly, Or, not to keep harping on that poor phrase, Doing harm to it, you'll “offer” me a fool!
My lord, he has courted me with love In honorable fashion.
And has given proper appearance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Yes, mousetraps to catch fools.
I do know, When passion burns the blood, how the wasteful soul Gives the tongue vows to speak.
These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, dead in both, Even in their promises, dying as they are being made, Must not be taken for real fire.
As for Lord Hamlet, Only believe so much about him, that he is young, And he may walk on a higher mountain Than may be given you.
In short, Ophelia, Don’t believe his vows, because they are pimps, Not made of those things which show outside, But mere beggars of unholy courtships, Breathing like holy and righteous procurers, The better to deceive you.
Do as I say, I order you.
Let’s go.
I shall obey, my lord. 
The air bites sharply, It is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What time is it now?
I think it’s just before twelve.
No, the clock has already struck twelve.
Indeed?
I didn’t hear it.
Then it’s getting close to the time When the spirit has his habit of walking.
What does that mean, my lord?
The King stays awake tonight and has a drinking party, Keeps toasting, and the swaggering morning whirls, And, as he drinks down his drafts of Rhine wine, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus noisily announce The triumph of his drinking it all down at once.
Is it a custom?
Yes, by Mary, it is, But to my mind, though I am a native here, And know the customs since birth, it is a custom More honored in the braking it than the observing it.
So often it might happen in particular men That, for some vicious disfigurement of nature in them, Like a birthmark— something they are not guilty of Because a man cannot choose how he is born— By the overdevelopment of some temperament, That often defies the intelligent use of reason, Or by some habit, that too much exceeds The limits of acceptable behavior, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being the result of nature, or a star of fortune, Whatever other virtues they have, even if they are As pure as grace, as infinite as men may have, Shall in the general opinion be labeled corrupt From that one particular fault.
The drop of affliction Often causes doubt about all the virtues they have To men’s own disgrace.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Whether you are a spirit of health or a goblin damned, Bringing with you airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Whether your intentions are wicked or charitable, You come in such a questionable shape That I will speak to you.
O, answer me!
Don’t let me burst in ignorance, but tell me Why your sacred bones, buried in death, Have escaped from the cemetery, why the tomb Wherein we saw you quietly laid to rest, Has opened his frightening and marble jaws To bring you back to life!
What does this mean, That you, dead corpse, again in full armor, Revisit us in the light and shadows of the moon, Making night hideous, and making us fools of nature Shake our dispositions so horridly With thoughts that go beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this?
Why?
What should we do?
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it had something to say To you alone.
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more private ground.
But don’t go with it!
No, by no means.
If it will not speak, then I will follow it.
Don’t, my lord.
Why, what should I be afraid of?
I don’t value my life at the price of a pin, And as for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing that is immortal as it is?
It waves me forward again.
I’ll follow it.
What if it tempts you toward the ocean, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea, And once there, assumes some other horrible form Which might deprive you of the ability to think, And draw you into madness?
Think about it.
The very place puts desperate ideas, Without any motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms into the sea And hears it roar beneath.
It waves me still.
Go on, I’ll follow you.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands.
Listen to me: you shall not go.
My fate cries out, And makes each and every vein in this body As hardy as the nerve of the lion killed by Hercules.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that holds me back!
I say, get away from me!
He’s getting crazy with expectation!
Let’s do it.
What will all this lead to?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will guide its course.
No, let's follow him. 
Where will you lead me?
Speak!
I’ll go no further.
Listen to me.
I will.
Don’t pity me, but listen seriously To what I shall disclose to you.
Speak, I am obliged to listen.
So you are obliged to revenge, when you shall hear me.
What?
I am your father's spirit, Doomed for a certain time to walk the night, And during the day I am confined to burn in fires, Until the evil crimes I had done in my life Are burnt and purged away.
If I were not forbidden To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could tell a tale whose lightest word Would crush your soul, freeze your young blood, Make your two eyes, like stars, jump from their sockets, Your knotted and combined hair to separate, And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills on the angry porcupine.
But this eternal description must not be given To ears of flesh and blood.
Listen, listen, O, listen!
If you ever loved your dear father — O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as even at best it is still murder, But this murder is the most foul, strange, and unnatural.
Tell me about it quickly, so that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May rush to my revenge.
I find you ready, And if you were duller than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on the river bank, You wouldn’t move on this.
Now, Hamlet, listen.
The story goes that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent bit me.
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle!
O Hamlet, what a falling-off there was in our marriage!
But as virtue can never be moved, it Was courted though lewdness in a shape of heaven, And lust, though linked to a radiant angel, Will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed And eat garbage.
But wait!
O, horrible!
O, horrible!
Most horrible!
But, however you pursue this revenge, Don’t taint your mind, or let your soul plan Anything against your mother.
Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that live in her bosom, To prick and sting her.
Goodbye now!
The glowworm shows the morning is near, And he begins to put out his ineffective fire.
Goodbye, goodbye!
Hamlet, remember me.
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
what else?
And shall I join forces hell?
O, for shame!
Remember you!
Yes, you poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this confused world.
Remember you!
Yes, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all unimportant records, All kinds of books, all pictures, all pressures past, That my youth and observations wrote there, And your commandment all by itself shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with other low thoughts.
Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My papers, it is just that I set it all down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain, At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are.
Now to my word: It is Goodbye, goodbye!
remember me.
I have sworn it.
So be it!
Hello, ho, ho, my lord!
Hello, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.
How are you, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
O, wonderful!
My good lord, tell it.
No, you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Nor I, my lord.
What do you say then, would heart of man once think it?
And you'll keep it secret?
Yes, by heaven, my lord.
There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark Except that he's an arrant knave.
We don’t need a ghost, my lord, to come from the grave To tell us this.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I’m sorry they offend you, heartily, Yes, indeed, heartily.
There's no offense, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.
Regarding this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that I can tell you.
As for your desire to know what happened between us, Control it the best you can.
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
What is it, my lord?
We will.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
My lord, we will not.
No, but swear it.
Really, My lord, I would not.
Nor I, my lord, really.
Swear on my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, on my sword, indeed.
Swear.
Are you there, trusty fellow?
Come on!
Tell us the oath, my lord.
Swear.
You are everywhere?
then we'll move our ground.
Come over here, gentlemen, And lay your hands again on my sword.
Never to speak of what you have heard, Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Well said, old mole!
Can you work in the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!
Once more, leave, good friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore, as a stranger, welcome it.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Swear.
Rest, rest, irritated spirit!
Let’s go in together, And still keeping your silence, I beg you.
The time is so out of whack.
O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!
No, come, let's go together. 
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You would do very well, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to ask someone About his behavior.
My lord, I did intend to ask.
By Mary, well said, very well said.
Look here, sir, First ask what Danes are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they live, What company, at what expense, and finding, By this talking around and drift of questions, That they who do know my son, come nearer to you Than your particular questions will touch it.
Assume, as it were, that you have only heard about him, Such as, “I know his father and his friends, And in part him”, are you listening to me, Reynaldo?
Yes, very well, my lord.
And in part him, but,” you may say, “not very well.
As gaming, my lord.
Yes, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Prostitution.
You may go that far.
My lord, that would dishonor him.
Just as you mention it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to inconstancy.
Just tell his faults so quaintly That they may seem to be the stains of freedom, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in wild blood, An attack that everyone goes through.
But, my good lord, Why should you do this?
Yes, my lord, I want to know that.
By Mary, sir, here's my intention:, And I believe it is a trick of protection.
And then, sir, ask if he does this, does he--What was I about to say?
So, using my lecture and advice from before, You shall check on my son.
You understand me, yes?
My lord, I do.
My good lord!
Observe his inclinations in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him practice his music.
Well, my lord.
Goodbye!
Alas, my lord, I have been so frightened!
By what, in the name of God?
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his shirt all unbuttoned, No hat upon his head, his stockings dirty, Not pulled up, and fallen down around his ankles, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking together, And with a look so pitiful in its meaning As if he had been freed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
Crazy for your love?
My lord, I don’t know, But I truly fear it.
What did he say?
He took me by the wrist, and held me hard, Then he went to the length of his whole arm, And with his other hand like this over his brow, He started such study of my face As though he wanted to draw it.
Come, go with me.
I will look for the king.
This is the very passion of love Whose violent property kills itself, And leads the will to desperate undertakings As often as any passion under heaven That afflicts our natures.
No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did reject his letters and denied His access to me.
That has made him crazy.
I am sorry that I didn’t treat him with better heed and Judgment.
I was afraid he was only trifling with you And meant to wreck you, but curse my jealousy!
It seems it is as proper for our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
Come, let’s go to the king.
This must be known, which, if kept secret, might mean More trouble to hide it than hate for utter love. 
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
In addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for A long time, the reason we need to see you made us Send our hasty invitation.
What the problem should be, More than his father's death that has put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.
I beg you both That, being childhood friends and brought up with him, And since you know well his youth and disposition, That you will be pleased to rest here in our court For a while, so that, with your company, you Draw him on to enjoy himself, and to gather, So much as from any occasion you may glean, Whether anything, unknown to us, afflicts him like this, That, once we know, we can make better.
Good gentlemen, he has much talked of you, And I am sure that there are not living two men With whom he feels close.
If you will please Show us so much gentry and goodwill As to spend your time with us a while, To help us find out what is troubling him, Your visit shall receive such thanks As only a King can give.
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your huge request more into a command Than to an entreaty.
We both obey, And here we give up ourselves, without reservation, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beg you instantly to visit My too much changed son.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
May the heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Yes, amen!
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.
You have always been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord?
I assure you, my good lord, I believe my duty is, as I believe in my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king.
And I do think— or else this brain of mine Doesn’t know the trail of policy as surely As it used to do—, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
Introduce yourself to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my sweet queen, he has found The head and source of all your son's unhappiness.
I doubt it is none other than the main reason, His father's death and our overly hasty marriage.
Well, we shall figure him out.
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what news from our ally, Norway?
We really like this news, And later when we have more time we'll read this Request, answer, and think upon this business.
In the meantime, we thank you for a job well done.
Get some rest, tonight we'll feast together.
A great welcome home!
This business is well ended.
Crazy” I call it, because to define true craziness, What is it except to be nothing else but crazy?
But ignore that.
Madam, I swear I use no clever words at all.
It remains like this, and the remainder like this.
Consider.
I have a daughter, have while she is mine, Who, in her duty and obedience, listen, Has given me this.
Now listen and understand.
You may doubt you that the stars are fire, ”You may doubt that the sun does move, ”You may doubt truth to be a liar, ”But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am sick at the number of my sighs, I don’t have the skill to calculate my groans.
but that I love you best, O most best, believe it.
Adieu.
Yours evermore, most dear lady, while this brain is in him, HAMLET.
This my daughter has shown this to me in obedience, And furthermore, has his gifts, Which she has described to me by the time, by means, and place they were received.
But how has she Received his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honorable.
I would gladly prove so.
Do you think it is this?
It may be, very likely.
Has there been such a time, I’d gladly know that, That I have positively said “it is so,” And it wasn’t?
Not that I know of.
Take this from this, if this isn’t the case now.
If get the opportunity, I will find Where truth is hidden, though it were hidden indeed Within the centre of the man.
How can we find out more?
You know sometimes he walks for hours and hours Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time, I’ll make sure my daughter meets him.
You and I will be behind a curtain then, Listening to their encounter.
If he doesn’t love her, And he’s not gone crazy because of love, Let me be no assistant for a state, But be a farmer and horse carter.
We will try it.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
O, give me permission.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well, God have mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Not I, my lord.
Then I wish you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord!
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breeds maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing rotten flesh— Have you a daughter?
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk in the sun.
Pregnancy is a blessing, but not as your daughter may get pregnant.
Friend, look to it.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.
He is far gone, far gone!
In my youth I truly suffered much agony for love almost like this.
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you are reading, my lord.
all of which, sir, although I believe it most powerfully and potently, yet I think it was dishonest to have written it like this, because you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
Into my grave?
Indeed, that is out of the air.
Aside.
How full of meaning his replies sometimes are!
A happiness that often craziness hits on, which reason and sanity couldn’t arranged so happily.
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part with, except my life, except my life, except my life.
Goodbye, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
God save you, sir!
My honored lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends!
How are you, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do you both?
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
God, we are her privates.
In the secret parts of fortune?
What's the news?
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Prison, my lord!
Denmark's a prison.
Then the world is one.
A goodly one, in which there are many cells, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
We don’t think so, my lord.
Why, then it is not a prison to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so.
To me, it is a prison.
O God, I could be put into a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, if it were not that I have bad dreams.
Those dreams are indeed ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
Then our beggars are bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes are the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to the court?
for, by my faith, I cannot reason.
We'll wait upon you.
That’s not necessary.
I won’t sort you with the rest of my servants, because, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended.
But, in the beaten way of friendship, what are you doing at Elsinore?
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are a halfpenny too expensive.
Weren’t you sent for?
Is it your own desire to come here?
Is it a free visit?
Come on, Tell me the truth.
What should we say, my lord?
Why, anything but to the answer.
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which you are not very good at hiding.
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
What for, my lord?
You have to tell me.
But let me beg you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the harmony of our youth, by the obligation of our ever preserved love, and by anything else that could charge you to be even and direct with me, were you were sent for or not?
What do you say?
My lord, we were sent for.
I have of late, but why I don’t know, lost all my joy, given up all habits of exercises, and indeed, I am so depressed that this good frame, the earth, seems to me to be a sterile outpost, this most excellent canopy, the air— look—, this brave sky hanging over us, this majestic roof divided with golden fire, why, it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors.
What a piece of work is man!
How noble in reason!
how infinite in faculties!
in form and moving, how expressive and admirable!
In action how like an angel!
in understanding, how like a god!
And yet, to me, what is this highly refined speck of dust?
Man doesn’t delight me, no, nor woman either, though by your smiling, you seem to find that funny.
My lord, there wasn’t any such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said, “Man doesn’t delight me”?
To think, my lord, if you do not delight in man, what a somber reception the players shall receive from you.
We passed them on the way, and they are coming here to perform.
What players are they?
Even those you usually enjoy, the tragedians of the city.
How is it that they travel?
Being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits.
I think their traveling to perform a play is a new innovation.
Do they hold the same respect they did when I was in the city?
Are they still followed?
No, indeed, they are not.
Why?
Do they grow rusty?
No, their work keeps them at their usual pace, but there is, sir, a brood of children, untrained, that complicate their situation, and are most tyrannically beaten for it.
Children are now very popular, and are on the common stages, as they call them, so much that many actors are afraid they cannot compete and barely dare to come there.
What, are they children?
Who cares for them?
Where do they live?
Will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing?
Won’t they say later, if they should go on to become common players, which is likely, and their lives are no better, that their writers did them wrong to make them exclaim against their own success?
Well, there has been a lot of comment on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy.
There was, for a while, no money paid for debate unless the poet and the player fought over the question.
Is it possible?
O, there has been a lot of bashing of brains going on.
Do the boys carry them away?
Yes, they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too.
It is not very strange, for my uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make faces at him while my father lived, paid twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats each for a little picture of him.
God’s blood!, there is something more than natural in this, if philosophy could figure it out.
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Let me shake your hands.
The accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony.
Let me comply with it in these clothes, for fear that my welcome to the players, which I tell you must look good, should more appear like entertainment than your plays.
You are welcome.
but my uncle-father and aunt- mother are deceived.
In what, my dear lord?
I am but crazy north-north-west.
When the wind is from the south, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Welcome, gentlemen!
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, with each ear.
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes.
Happily this is the second time he uses them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
I predict he comes to tell me of the players, listen.
You say right, sir.
On Monday morning, it was true indeed.
Buzz, buzz!
Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light.
For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure you had!
What treasure did he have, my lord?
Why,“One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well.” Still harping on my daughter.
Am I not in the right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
No, that doesn’t follow.
What follows, then, my lord?
Why, “As by lot, God knows,” and then, you know,”It came to pass, as most like it was.” The first line of the holy song will show you more, for look where my means of whiling away the time comes.
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all.
I am glad to see you well.
Welcome, good friends.
What, my young lady and mistress!
By our lady, your ladyship is taller than when I saw you last, by the height of a high-heeled shoe.
Pray God, your voice, like a an unused gold coin, can’t be cracked within the ring.
Masters, you are all welcome.
We'll act up like French falconers: fly at anything we see.
We'll have a speech right now.
Come, give us a bit of your quality.
Come, a passionate speech.
What speech, my lord?
I heard you do a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not more than once, for the play, I remember, didn’t please the crowd, it was caviar to the particular, but it was, as I took it, and others, whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine, an excellent play, well organized in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as skill.
I remember, one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy, and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs, but called it an honest effort, as wholesome as it was sweet, and, by very much, more handsome than fine.
If you can remember it, begin at this line, let me see, let me see.
By God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good judgment.
Eventually he finds him, Striking too short at the Greeks.
His old sword, Rebelling against his arm, lies where it falls, Resisting his commands.
Not matched equally, Pyrrhus lunges at Priam, strikes wild in rage, But, with the whiff and wind of his fierce sword, The shaken father falls.
Then senseless Priam, Seeming to feel this blow, flaming at his top Stoops to his base, and, with a hideous crash, Cuts off prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.
Behold!
his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seemed in the air to stick.
So, like a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And, as if not giving in to his will and body, Did nothing.
But, as we often see a silence in the heavens, After some storm, the gales stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the earth below As hushed as death, and eventually the dreadful thunder Tears the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, A roused anger renews him and he begins to work, And never did the One-eyed monster’s hammers fall On the god of war’s amour, forged for eternal strength, With less sorrow than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, you loose woman, Fortune!
All you gods, In general meeting, take away her power, Break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel, And bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of heaven, As low as you can to kill the fiends!
This is too long.
It shall go to the barber's, to be cut with your beard.
I beg you, continue.
He's for a jig or a dirty tale, or he sleeps.
Continue, come to Hecuba.
Wrapped up queen” is good.
Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With blind tears, a cloth on that head Where lately the crown had stood, and for a robe, About her thin loins, exhausted from child-bearing, A blanket, caught up in the panic of fear, Whoever had seen this, with a very poisoned tongue, Would have pronounced treason against Fortune's state.
But if the gods themselves saw her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport By chopping her husband’s limbs with his sword, The instant burst of noise that she made, Unless mortal events can’t move them at all, Would have made the burning eyes of heaven milk, And rouse passion in the gods.
Look, where he has turned pale, and has tears in his eyes.
I beg you, no more!
It is well.
I’ll have you speak out the rest of this soon.
My good lord, will you see the players well taken care of?
Do you hear me?
Let them be well used, for they are the short stories and brief history of the time.
After you die, it would be better to have a bad epitaph then than their ill report while you live now.
My lord, I will use them according to their class.
God’s bodkin, man, better.
Use every man according to his class, and who should escape whipping?
Use them according to your class.
The less they deserve it, the more credit it is to you.
Take them in.
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends.
we'll hear a play tomorrow.
Do you hear me, old friend?
We'll have it tomorrow night.
Yes, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that lord, and see you don’t mock him.
I’ll leave you till night.
You are welcome to Elsinore.
My good lord!
Yes, so, God be with you!
Now I am alone.
O, what a idle, wandering, and peasant slave I am!
Isn’t it monstrous that this actor here, Only in a play, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own actions That his grew pale from the words of the speech, Tears in his eyes, separation from reality in his face, A broken voice, and his whole function matching Forms to his role?
And all for nothing!
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?
What would he do If he had the motive and the cue for passion That I have?
He would drown the stage with tears And split the audience’s with horrid speech, Make the guilty crazy, and shock the innocent, Confuse the ignorant, and amaze, indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain?
Breaks my head across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose?
Lies about me in the throat As deep as the lungs?
Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass I am!
This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murdered, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, release the content of my heart with words, and fall down cursing like a very drab, Menial servant in the kitchen!
Shame on it!
Argh!
Change course, my brain!
I have Heard that guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have been so struck to the soul By the very cunning of the scene that presently They have confessed their evil deeds, Because murder, although it is silent, will speak With its own most miraculous organ, I’ll have these Players play something like the murder of my father Before my uncle.
I’ll observe his looks, I’ll watch his every move.
Even if he only winks, I know what I have to do.
I’ll need to have more proof than this.
The play's the thing Wherein I’ll see the conscience of the king. 
And can’t you, by any circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this craziness, Grating all his days of quiet so harshly With turbulence and dangerous lunacy?
He does confess that he feels himself troubled, But he will by no means speak about the cause.
Nor do we find him easy to figure out the reason why, Because, with a crafty craziness, keeps his distance When we try to bring him to some confession Of his true state.
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
But with much forcing to make himself do it.
Difficult to question, but, when we ask for something, He is most free in his reply.
Did you try to get him To engage in any pastime?
Madam, it just so happened that certain players We passed on the way here.
We told him about them, And it seemed to make him happy To hear of it.
They are here at the court, And, I think, they are already hired To play before him tonight.
This is very true, And he begged me to invite your majesties To hear and see the play.
With all my heart, and it makes me happy To hear that he is so inclined.
Good gentlemen, cut him some slack, And keep his attentions on these delights.
We shall, my lord.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, For we have secretly sent for Hamlet to come here, That here he may, as if by accident Meet Ophelia.
Her father and I, lawful spies, Will so hide ourselves that, seeing but unseen, We may honestly judge their encounter, And gather from him, or how he behaves, If it’s the affliction of his love or not That he suffers like this for.
I really hope your virtues Will bring him to his usual way again, To the honor of both of you.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, you walk here.
Gracious king, if it pleases you, We will bestow ourselves.
Read this book, Showing that such an exercise may colours Your loneliness.
We are often to blame in this, it’s been proven often, that with devotion's face and holy actions, we sugar over The Devil himself.
O, it is too true!
How hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience!
The prostitute's cheek, covered with makeup, Isn’t more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my very artificial words.
O heavy burden!
I hear him coming.
Let's hide, my lord.
There's the respect That makes a mess of long life, For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's insults, The pangs of rejected love, the law's delay, The inexperience of office, and the disdain That patient merit takes from the unworthy, When he himself might his final settlement make With a bare, sharp knife?
Who would bear these burdens To grunt and sweat under a weary life, Except that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose borders No traveler returns, puzzles the mind, And makes us bear those problems we have Rather than fly to others that we don’t know about?
In this way, a conscience can make cowards of us all, And in this way the natural color of making up your mind Is covered with the pale shadow of thinking, And projects of great substance and significance, And in this regard, their movement turns erratic, And lose the name of action.
Wait!
The fair Ophelia!
Nymph, in your eyes May all my sins be remembered.
My good lord, How has your honor been for this many a day?
I humbly thank you, Well, well, well.
My lord, I have mementos of yours That I have longed to re-deliver to you for a long time.
I beg you, take them back now.
My honored lord, you know right well you did, And with them, words composed of so sweet an air As made the things more rich.
Their sweet air being Gone, take them back again, because to the noble mind Rich gifts grow poor when the givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
Are you sincere?
My lord?
Are you truthful?
What do you mean?
That if you be sincere and truthful, your sincerity shouldn’t have any talks to your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better dealings than with sincerity?
Yes, truly, for the power of beauty will transform sincerity from what it is to a pimp faster than the force of sincerity can translate beauty into his image.
This used to be contradictory, but now the time proves it’s true.
I did love you once.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
You should not have believed me, for virtue can’t graft a new plant onto our old stock but we shall relish of it.
I didn’t love you.
I was deceived all the more.
Get yourself to a convent.
Why would you give birth to sinners?
I don’t care about my sincerity, but I could accuse myself of such things that it were better my mother had not had me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my command than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to commit them in.
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?
We are wicked men, all, believe none of us.
Take yourself a convent.
Where's your father?
At home, my lord.
Shut the doors on him, that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house.
Goodbye.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
If you do, by Mary, I’ll give you this curse for your wedding gift: whether you as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, you shalt not escape slander.
Go to a convent, go.
Goodbye.
Or, if you will marry, make it a fool, by Mary, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
To a convent, go, and quickly too.
Goodbye.
O heavenly powers, restore him!
You dance, you walk, and you whisper and nickname animals, and make your looseness your ignorance.
I say, we will have no more marriages.
those that are married already, all but one, shall live, the rest stay the same.
To a convent, go.
O, what a noble mind here is conquered!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, voice, sword, The hope and flower of Denmark, The mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite taken down!
And I of all ladies most dejected and wretched That has tasted the honey of his musical vows, Now see that noble and most royal mind, Like sweet bells jangling, out of tune and harsh to hear, That form and feature of blown youth without equal Totally crazy.
O, woe is me, To have seen the man I have seen, see the man I see!
Love!
his affections don’t go that way, And what he said, though it was a little unorganized, Wasn’t like craziness.
There's something in his soul Over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg, And I doubt that egg will hatch and the “bird” Will be something dangerous, which to prevent, I have quickly decided To write it down like this.
Happily the seas, and different countries With other things, shall cure and get rid of This problem in his heart that has such a hold on him, Which his still active brain makes him like this From being himself.
What do you think about it?
It’ll be OK.
But I still believe The source and beginning of his grief Began with rejected love.
How are you, Ophelia!
My lord, do as you please, But if you think it’s OK, after the play, Let his queen mother talk to him all alone and beg him To share his problem.
Let her be strict with him, And I’ll be hide, if it pleases you, so I can hear Of all their conference.
If she can’t find out what’s wrong, Then send him to England, or lock him up where You think is the best place.
That’s what I’ll do.
Craziness in great ones must not go unwatched. 
Speak the part, I beg you, as I read it to you, lightly on your tongue.
But if you just repeat it, as many actors do, I would prefer the town crier spoke my lines.
O, it offends me to the soul to hear a hefty fellow with a wig tear an emotion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the cheap seats, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but confusing pantomime and noise.
Please avoid it.
I assure you.
But don’t be too tame either, but let your own discretion be your teacher.
Fit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special rule, that you don’t overstep the simplicity of being natural, for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature, to show truth in reality, scorn her falseness, and his form and force to the very age and body of the time.
Now, this overacting, or lateness, though it make the ignorant laugh, can only make the experienced grieve, in whose opinion, you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance.
O, there are actors that I have seen perform and heard others praise, and highly too, not to speak too harshly, that, having neither the accent of Christians, nor the walk of a Christian, a pagan, or a man, have so strutted and yelled that I have thought some of nature's hired help had made them and not made them well, they imitated mankind so dreadfully.
I hope we have calmly overcome those problems, sir.
O, overcome them with zeal.
That's horrible and shows very bad manners in the fool that uses it.
Go get ready.
How are you, my lord!
Will the king hear this piece of work?
And the queen too, and they should be here presently.
We will, my lord.
What, here, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, you are just like the man That my conversation just now praised.
Why should the poor be flattered?
No, let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory, And bend the obvious hinges of the knee Where poverty may follow flattery.
Do you hear me?
Since my dear soul controlled her choice, And could recognize men of truth, her choice Has taken you for herself.
Because you have been As one, that in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that Fortune's feasts and rewards Have taken with equal thanks, and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well blended That they are not an instrument for Fortune's finger To play whatever song she pleases.
Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, yes, in my heart of heart, As I do you.
OK, enough of that.
There is a play tonight before the king.
One scene of it comes near the circumstances, Which I have told you, of my father's death.
I beg you, when you see that act begin, Even with the very criticism of your soul Watch my uncle.
If his hidden guilt Don’t show itself in that one speech, It is a false ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as unstable As god of fire’s anvil.
Watch him carefully, Because I will have my eyes riveted on his face, And, after the play, we will combine our observations In condemning of his actions.
Well, my lord.
If he steals anything the while this play is going on, And he escapes detection, I will pay for the theft.
They are coming to the play.
I must be idle.
Go get yourself a seat.
How’s our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, really, of the chameleon's dish.
I eat the air, crammed with promises.
You can’t eat capons that way.
No, for me now.
My lord, you acted once when you were in the university, you say?
That did I, my lord, and I was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar, I was killed in the Capitol, Brutus killed me.
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a stupid fellow there.
Are the players ready?
Come hear, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
O, ho!
Do you see that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, lay my head on your lap?
Yes, my lord.
Do you think I meant sexual matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, me?
Yes, my lord.
O, your only dancer!
What should a man do but be merry?
Because look how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
No, it is four months, my lord.
So long?
No then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of black fur.
O heavens!
Died two months ago and not forgotten yet?
By Mary, this is miching mallecho, it means mischief.
It’s as if this show describes the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep a secret, they'll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Yes, or any show that you'll show him.
If you are not ashamed to show, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
Keep quiet, keep quiet.
I’ll watch the play.
For us and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg you listen patiently.
Is this a prologue or a ring of flowers?
It is short, my lord.
As woman's love.
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us count again before love is finished!
That I don’t trust you.
Now, you know how I love you has been proven to you, And as my love is cannot be measured, so is my fear.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are very fearful, Where little fears grow great, great love also grows there.
Such love must be treason in my breast.
Let me be cursed if I marry again!
No one marries the second without killing the first love.
The reasons for a second marriage Are low respects of saving money, but not for love.
I kill my husband dead a second time When second husband kisses me in bed.
I believe you believe what you say now, But what we determine to, often we don’t.
Promises are only good when you remember them, Born of violence but poor truth, Which now, like unripe fruit, stays on the tree, But fall without shaking them off when they are ripe.
It is very necessary that we forget To pay ourselves what we owe to ourselves.
What we promise ourselves in a fit of passion, When the passion ends, so does the promise.
The violence of either grief or joy Destroys their own keeping of them with themselves.
Where joy celebrates, grief mourns greatly, Grief joys, joy griefs, on a very slender event.
This world doesn’t say yes, and it’s not strange at all That even our loves should change with our fortunes, Because it’s a question we have to prove, When love leads fortune, or if fortune leads love.
But, to go back to where I started, Our wills and fates run in so much in different directions, That our plans are still turned upside down, Our thoughts are ours, but their results aren’t ours.
So you think you won’t marry again, But you’ll change your mind when your first lord is dead.
If she should break the moment now!
It is a very deep oath.
Sleep rock your brain, And may misfortune never mischance between us two!
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady protests too much, I think.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the story?
It’s not offensive, is it?
No, no!
They only pretend, pretend to poison, no offense in the world.
What’s the name of the play?
The Mousetrap.
By Mary, how?
A metaphor.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
but what o' that?
your majesty, and we that have free souls can’t be touched by it.
Let the bitter hussy kick, our saddles don’t pinch.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
You are a good chorus, my lord.
I could translate between you and your love, if I could see the toys flirting.
You are forward, my lord, you are forward.
It would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me.
Even better, and worse.
And that’s how you must take your husbands.
Begin, murderer, argh!
Enough with the bad faces, and begin.
He poisons him in the garden for his estate.
His name's Gonzago.
The King rises.
What, frightened by false fire!
How are you, my lord?
Stop the play.
Give me some light.
Let’s go!
Lights, lights, lights!
Wouldn’t this do it, sir, together with a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn against with me, with two Provincial roses on my shoes I took off, to get me a fellowship for writing with a pack of players, sir?
Half a share.
You might have rhymed those lines.
O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost's word for as real as a thousand dollars!
Did you see?
Very well, my lord.
When the talk was about the poisoning?
I watched him very well.
Ah, ha!
Come, some music!
Come, some music!
My good my lord, may I a word with you.
Sir, I’ll give you a whole history.
The king, sir Yes, sir, what about him?
He’s, in his retirement to bed, exceedingly upset.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord, rather with anger.
You’d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor, because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry.
My good lord, please re-phrase what you’re saying, and don’t give me answers so far away from my question.
I am calm, sir.
Ask away.
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, has sent me to you.
You are welcome.
No, good my lord, this courtesy is not the right answer.
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command, or rather, as you say, my mother shall command.
OK, I’ll say no more but to the problem.
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!
But isn’t there a sequel that follows this mother's surprise?
She wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
We shall obey, if she were ten times our mother.
Have you any else to tell me?
My lord, you loved me once.
And I still do, by these thieves and robbers.
My good lord, what is your cause of your problem?
You certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you don’t tell your problems to your friend.
Sir, I don’t have a promotion.
How can that be, when the king himself says you will succeed him to the throne in Denmark?
Yes, sir, but “While the grass grows”— the proverb is a bit old-fashioned.
O, the pipes.
Let me see one.
To divert your attention, why do you go about trying to figure me out, as if you’re to pick a fight?
O my lord, if my duty is too bold, it’s because my love has no manners.
I don’t understand that at all.
Will you play on this pipe?
My lord, I can’t.
I beg you.
Believe me, I can’t.
I’m begging you.
I don’t know how to play it, my lord.
It’s as easy as lying.
Just close up these holes with your finger and thumb, put it in your mouth and blow, and it will yield the most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the holes to cover.
Why, look here, at what an unworthy a thing you make of me!
You would play me, you would seem to know my holes to cover, you want to pick out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest note to the my highest note, and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little pipe, yet you can’t play it.
Do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe?
Call me whatever instrument you want to, although you can try to cover my holes me, you can’t play me.
God bless you, sir!
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right now.
Do you see that cloud over there that's almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, it is indeed like a camel.
I think it is like a weasel.
It is shaped like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then I will go to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
By-and-by is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
Now, it’s the very witching time of night, When churchyards awake, and hell itself breathes out Disease to this world.
Now I could drink hot blood, And do such wicked deed that the day Would shake nervously to see.
Listen!
now to my mother.
O heart, don’t give up now, don’t ever let the soul of Nero, the crazy emperor, enter this determined heart.
I don’t like him, and it doesn’t seem to be safe to us To let his craziness run free.
The terms of our estate may not endure With danger so near to us as his craziness seems To get worse by the hour.
We will get ourselves ready.
It’s a most holy and religious fear To keep those many, many bodies safe That depend upon your majesty.
The single and peculiar life is bound, With all the strength and amour of the mind, To keep itself from madness, but much more so For that spirit on whose government the lives of many Depend and rest.
The government of a King Dies with him, but draws what's near it with it, like a gulf.
It is a massive wheel, Set at the top of the highest mountain, In which its huge spokes, ten thousand little things Are firmly glued together, that, when the wheel falls, Each small piece, insignificant event, Adds to the noisy ruin of the country.
The King never Sighed by himself, but with the whole country’s groan.
Get started, I beg you, on this speedy voyage, For we will control this fear, Which now goes about too freely.
We will go quickly.
My lord, he's going to his mother's bedroom.
I’ll hide myself behind the curtain so I can hear what happens, I’ll guarantee she'll set him Straight.
And, as you said, and wisely it was said, It is proper that some beside his mother, Since nature makes them subjective, should overhear The speech objectively.
Goodbye, my lord.
I’ll call on you before you go to bed, And tell you what I know.
Thanks, my dear lord.
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with my brother's blood, Isn’t there enough rain in the sweet heavens To wash it as white as snow?
What use is mercy Except to confront the face of offense?
And what's in prayer except this double force, To be prevented from falling down, Or pardoned since we are down?
Then I’ll look up, My sin is committed.
But, O, what form of prayer Can help me?
Forgive me of my foul murder!
That can’t be it, since I still have All those things for which I did the murder, My crown, my own ambition, and my queen.
May one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits?
What then?
What stops?
I’ll see what being sorry does.
What can’t it do?
O heart as black as death!
O dissolving soul, that, struggling to be free, Is more a slave!
Help, angels!
Make an attempt.
Bow, stubborn knees, and, heart, with strings of steel, Be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby!
All may be well.
I must think about that.
A villain kills my father, and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven.
O, this is a contract and pay, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of food, With all his sins on his soul, as full of bloom as May, And how his report stands, who knows except heaven?
No.
Up, sword, and know a more horrid intention.
When he is asleep drunk, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing, or committing some act That has no element of salvation in it, Then attack him, so that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell, where it goes to.
My mother is waiting.
This relief only makes your sickly days longer.
My words go up, my thoughts stay here below.
Words without thoughts never go to heaven. 
He will come right away.
See that you are direct with him.
Tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up With, and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because Of him.
I’ll hide here silently.
I beg you, be firm with him.
Hide, I hear him coming.
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, you have offended your father very much.
Mother, you have offended my father very much.
Come, come, you answer me stupidly.
Go, go, you answer me with wickedness.
Why, how can you, Hamlet!
What's the matter now?
Have you forgotten I’m your mother?
No, by the church, I haven’t.
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife, And, I wish it wasn’t so, but you are my mother.
No, then, I’ll send those to you who can speak.
What will you do?
You wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
What, ho!
help, help, help!
Draws.
O, I am slain!
O me, what have you done?
No, I don’t know.
Is it the king?
O, what a thoughtless and bloody deed this is!
A bloody deed!
Almost as bad, good mother, As killing a king and marrying his brother.
As killing a king!
Yes, lady, that’s what I said.
You wretched, rash, intruding fool, goodbye!
I mistook you for the King.
Leave wringing of your hands.
Quiet!
What have I done, that you dare scream at me So loudly and rudely?
Heaven's face glows— Yes, this solid and compound body With a trustful face— as against the end of the world, Is sickened by the thought of the act.
Ah me, what act Roars so loudly and thunders in the wind?
Look here upon this picture and on this one, The representation of two brothers.
Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear of corn Poisoning his wholesome brother.
Have you got eyes?
Could you feed on this fair mountain, And glut yourself on this swamp?
Huh?
have you got Eyes?
What devil Was it that trick you like this with a blindfold?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling without them all, Or a sickly part of one true sense Couldn’t act like this without a conscious thought.
O shame!
Aren’t you embarrassed?
Rebellious hell, If you can rebel in an old lady’s bones, Then let virtue be like wax to burning youth, And melt in her own fire.
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive passion takes charge, Since frost itself burns as well, And reason pimps the will.
O Hamlet, don’t say anything else.
You turn my eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grainy spots As will not leave their color.
No, but to live In the rotten sweat of an greasy bed, Stewed in corruption, using sweet words and making love Over the nasty pig sty.
No more.
A king of shreds and patches!
Save me and hover over me with your wings, You heavenly guards!
What does you gracious figure want?
Alas, he's crazy!
Don’t you come to scold your tardy son, That, forgetting time and passion, lets The important acting of your dread command go by?
O, tell me!
Don’t forget.
This visitation Is only to sharpen your almost dull purpose.
But, look, amazement sits on your mother’s face.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
How are you, lady?
Alas, how are you, That you look on empty space, And carry on a conversation with the invisible air?
Your spirits wildly peep from your eyes, And, as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm, Your bedded hairs, like life in growths, Start up and stand an end.
O gentle son, Sprinkle cool patience on the heat and flame of your Anger!
Where do you look?
On him, on him!
Look how pale he glares!
Then what I have to do Will need true colours, tears perhaps for blood.
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all, yet all that I see is.
You hear nothing?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look there!
Look how it steals away!
My father in his clothes as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now out the door!
This is the very product of your brain.
This bodiless creation Is very cunning In imagination.
Imagination!
My pulse does temperately keep time like yours, And is just as healthful as yours.
It’s not craziness That I have spoken.
Test me, And I will re-word the problem, which madness Would run away from.
Mother, for love of grace, Don’t put that flattering oil on your soul That says my craziness speaks and not your sin.
It will only create a scab and film over the ulcer, While rotten corruption, working within everything, Infects it unseen.
Confess yourself to heaven, Repent what's past, avoid what is to come, And don’t spread fertilizer on the weeds, To make them more rotten.
Forgive me my truth, Because, in the fatness of these wealthy times Virtue itself must beg pardon of vice, Yes, beg and court for permission to do him good.
O Hamlet, you cut my heart in two.
O, throw away the worse part of it, And live the purer life with the other half.
but don’t go to my uncle's bed, Act as though you have a virtue if you don’t have it.
That monster habit, who eats all sense, Of all evil habits is an angel in this, That in order to use fair and good actions, He likewise gives a dress or uniform That is ready to wear.
The next more easy, For use can almost change what is natural, And can either curb the devil or throw him out With wondrous effectiveness.
I am sorry, but heaven has decided it to be this way, To punish me with this act, and punish this act with me, That I must be their whip and whip-er.
I will hide him, and will answer the death I gave him well.
So again, goodnight.
One word more, good lady.
What shall I do?
Don’t think it’s good to tell him, For who except a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would hide from a frog, from a bat, a cat, Such dear concerns?
Who would do so?
No, in spite of sense and secrecy, Don’t open the basket on the roof, Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape To test conclusions, don’t creep into the basket And break your own neck.
Be assured, if words are made of breath, And breath is made of life, I have no life to breathe What you have said to me.
I must go to England, you know that?
Alack, I had forgotten.
Let it be, Because it’s the sport to have the swordsman Killed with his own sword, and it won’t be easy But I will dig one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon.
O, it is most sweet, When you can kill two birds with one stone.
Mother, goodnight.
Indeed, this counselor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was a foolish gabby rogue in life.
Come, sir, to finish up with you.
Good night, mother. 
There's a problem in these sighs.
Where is your son?
Leave us alone for a little while.
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How is Hamlet?
As crazy as the sea and wind, when both fight over Which is mightier.
In his wild fit, Hearing something stir behind the curtain, He whips out his knife, cries 'A rat, a rat!
And in this headstrong state, kills The hidden good old man.
O heavy deed!
It would’ve been us if we had been there.
His freedom is full of threats to everyone, To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be explained?
It will be our fault, who Should’ve kept this mad young man on a short leash, Restrained, and out of society.
But we loved him so much That we would not understand what was the best action, But, like the owner of a dirty disease, To keep it from showing, let it feed Even on the core of life.
Where has he gone?
He weeps for what is done.
O Gertrude, let’s go!
Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go get some further assistance.
Hamlet has Polonius slain in insanity, And he has dragged him from his mother's bedroom.
Go find him, speak gently, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I beg you, hurry.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends, And let them know both what we mean to do And what's done at an unfortunate time.
so maybe slander, whose whisper covers the entire world As surely as the cannon hits its target and Delivers his poisoned shot, may miss our name, And not amount to anything at all.
My soul is full of confusion and sorrow. 
Safely hidden.
Hamlet!
Lord Hamlet!
What’s that noise?
Who calls Hamlet?
Here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Mixed it with dust, to which it is related.
Tell us where it is, that we may take it from there, And carry it to the chapel.
Don’t believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your advice, and not my own.
You take me for a sponge, my lord?
Yes, sir, that soaks up the King's face, his rewards, his authorities.
But such officers do the king best service in the end.
He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first to be tasted, and then at last swallowed.
When he needs what you have found out, it is by squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
I don’t understand you, my lord.
I am glad of it.
A clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king.
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
The king is a thing, A thing, my lord!
Of nothing.
Bring me to him.
Hide, fox, and show all later. 
I have sent to find him and the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet we must not put the strong law on him.
He's very popular with this country’s masses, Who like not in their minds, but with their eyes, And where it is so, the offender's punishment is important, but never the offense.
To deal with everything smoothly and evenly, this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event.
Diseases grown desperate are best healed by desperate measures, Or not at all.
We cannot get from him Where the dead body is hidden, my lord.
But where is he?
Outside, my lord, guarded, to know what you want.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper.
At supper!
Where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
A certain group of educated worms are now biting him.
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
We fatten up all other creatures to fatten us up, when we fatten ourselves for maggots.
Your fat king and your lean beggar interchangeable, two dishes but for one table.
That's the end.
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king, and eat the fish that has fed on that worm.
What do you mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send there to see.
If your messenger can’t find him there, look for him in the other place yourself.
But, indeed, if you don’t find him within this month, you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
Go find him there.
He will stay until you come.
Hamlet, for this deed, for your special safety, Which we do consider as we dearly grieve For what you’ve done, we must send you away With fiery quickness.
For England!
Yes, Hamlet.
Good.
So it is, if you knew our reasons.
I see an angel that sees them.
But, come, for England!
Goodbye, dear mother.
Your loving father, Hamlet.
My mother.
Father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.
Come, for England!
I’ll have him away tonight.
Away!
because everything is sealed and done That relies on this affair.
I beg you, hurry.
And, England, if you hold my love at anything, As my great power may give you some sense, Since your scar still looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and your open fear Pays homage to us, you might not view Our sovereign process coldly, which gives you full power, By letters testifying to that effect, The present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England, Because, he rages like the pace of my blood, And you must cure me.
Until I know it is done, However great my luck, my joys can never begin. 
Go, Captain, send my greetings to the Danish king.
Tell him that, with his permission, Fortinbras Desires to carry out a promised march Over his kingdom.
You know the meeting place.
If his majesty has anything for us to do, We shall express our duty in person, And let him know so.
I will do it, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose armies are these?
They are from Norway, sir.
For what purpose, sir, I beg you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Does it go against the main part of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
To speak honestly, and with no addition to the facts, We go to gain a little patch of ground That’s not worth anything except its name.
To pay five dollars, five, I wouldn’t farm it, And it won’t yield either to Norway or the Poles A worse rate if it should it be sold in payment.
Why, then the Poles never will defend it.
Yes, it already has garrisons.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars Will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land.
This is the abscess of much wealth and peace, That breaks inward, and shows no damage until The man dies.
I humbly thank you, sir.
God be with you, sir.
Will you please go, my lord?
I’ll be with you right away.
Walk a little before me.
How every event works against me To spur my dull revenge!
What is a man, If his chief good and use of his time Is only to sleep and eat?
A beast, no more.
Surely He that made us with such large capacity, Looking before and after, didn’t give us That capability and godlike reason To go stale in us, unused.
Now, where it is Beastly forgetfulness, or some defeated principle Of thinking too much on the event, A thought which, cut in quarters, has but one part wisdom And always three parts coward, I don’t know Why I am still live to say “This thing's to do, “ Since I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do it.
Examples, as obvious as dirt, urge me.
Look at this army, of such size and power, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit, with divine ambition puffed up, Makes faces at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that luck, death, and danger dare to do, Even for an eggshell.
Rightly to be great Is not to move without great argument, But to find quarrel greatly in worthless land When honor’s at stake.
How do I stand, then, That have a father killed, a mother stained, Aggravation of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That, for a whim and trick of fame, Go to their graves like going to bed, fight for a plot On which the numbers don’t have room to fight for the Cause, which is not tomb enough and big enough To hide the slain?
O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be worth nothing! 
I will not speak with her.
She is unfortunate, indeed deranged.
Her mood must be pitied.
What does she need?
She speaks a lot about her father, she says she hears There are tricks in the world, and coughs, and beats her chest, Kicks enviously at nothing, says things in doubt That only make half sense.
her speech is nothing, Yet the random use of it moves The listeners to collect them, they aim at making sense of It, and mix her words up fit to their own ideas, Which, as her winks and nods and gestures as she Speaks, would indeed make someone think there might Be clear, though nothing for sure, yet very unhappily.
It would be good she were spoken with, because she May scatter dangerous ideas in rude minds.
Let her come in.
To my sick soul, such as sin's true nature is, Each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm.
Guilt is so full of artless jealousy, that It spills itself in fearing to be spilled.
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
How should I know your true love From another one?
By his whimsical bat and his staff And his sandal shoes.
Alas, sweet lady, what does this song mean?
What did you say?
No, I beg you, listen.
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone, At his head a grass green turf, At his heels a stone.
No, but Ophelia I beg you, listen.
His shroud is as white as the mountain snow, Alas, look here, my lord!
All covered with sweet flowers, Which drowned in tears went to the grave With showers of true love.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God protect you!
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but don’t know what we may be.
God be at your table!
Thinking on her father.
Then up he rose and put on his clothes, And opened the chamber door, Let in the maid that rejected a maid and Never left again.
Pretty Ophelia!
Indeed, la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on it.
By God and by Saint Charity, Pity, and for shame, for shame!
Young men will do it if they come to it, By God, they are to blame.
How long has she been like this?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient.
but I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him in the cold ground.
My brother shall know of it.
and so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach!
Follow her closely, watch her well, I beg you.
O, this is the poison of deep grief, it all springs From her father's death.
O my dear Gertrude, this worry, Compared to a murdering piece, gives me more than Enough death in many places.
For pity’s sake, what’s this noise?
Where are my Swiss guards?
Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?
Save yourself, my lord.
The ocean, exceeding of his borders, Doesn’t eat the flatlands with more impatient speed Than young Laertes, heading a riot, Takes over your offices.
The crowd calls him lord, And, as the world were just beginning now, Old history forgotten, customs not known, They certify and prop up every word, They cry “We choose!
O, this is rebellion, you false Danish dogs!
The doors are broken.
Where is this king?
Sirs, you all wait outside.
No, let's come in.
I beg you, leave me alone.
We will, we will.
I thank you.
Guard the door.
O you vile king, Give me my father!
Calmly, good Laertes.
That drop of blood that's in control says I’m a bastard, Cries my father’s wife was unfaithful, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unmarked brows Of my true mother.
What is the cause, Laertes, That your rebellion looks so huge?
There's such divinity that surrounds a king, That treason can only peep to what it would do, Acts little by his will.
Tell me, Laertes, Why are you so angry like this?
Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
Where is my father?
Dead.
But he didn’t do it.
Why is he dead?
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the deepest pit!
I dare damnation.
Who shall prevent you from it?
My will alone, nothing else in the world.
And I’ll use my methods so well, That they shall go far with little effort.
Good Laertes, If you desire to know the circumstances Of your dear father's death, is it written in your revenge That, in the gambling, you will draw both friend and foe, winner and loser?
No one but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
I’ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends, And, like the pelican of the old fables, Feed them with my own blood.
Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman.
It shall penetrate your understanding That I am innocent of your father's death, And am most sincerely in grief for it, As day penetrates your eye.
Let her come in.
How now!
What’s that noise?
O heat, dry up my brains!
Tears with seven times the Salt, burn out the sight and truth of my eyes!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens!
Is it possible a young maid's sanity Should be die as does an old man?
Nature is short in love, and where it is short, It sends some precious moment of itself Close to the thing it loves.
They bore him barefaced on the bier Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny And on his grave rained many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
Had you your sanity, and you persuaded me to revenge, It couldn’t move like this.
It is the false servant, that stole his master's daughter.
This “nothing” is more than just a story.
There's fennel for you, and columbines.
there's rue for you, and here's some for me.
There's a daisy.
I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead, Go to your death-bed, He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow, All white was his hair.
He is gone, he is gone, And we go away crying.
God have mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.
God be with you.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must share your grief, Or you deny me my rights.
Step aside, Choose whichever of your wisest friends you want, And they shall hear and judge between you and me.
If they find that we killed your father or had him killed, We will surrender our kingdom, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction, but if not, You must be patient with us, And we shall work together with your soul To give it just compensation.
I agree, His means of death, his obscure burial, No trophy, sword, no coat of arms over his bones No noble rites or state funeral, Cry to be heard, from heaven to earth as it were, That I must call it into question.
And so you shall, And wherever the guilt is, that’s where the punishment will be.
I beg you, go with me. 
Who wants to speak with me?
Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them in.
I don’t know from what part of the world I should be contacted, if not by Lord Hamlet.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless you too.
He shall, sir, if it pleases him.
Horatio, when you read this, give these fellows some way to talk to the king.
They have letters for him.
Before we were even at sea for two days, a very nasty looking pirate chased us.
Finding ourselves sailing too slow, we put up a great fight, and, in the skirmish, I boarded them.
Just then, they sailed away from our ship, so only I became their prisoner.
Let the king have the letters I have sent, and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death.
I have words to speak into your ear will make you speechless, but are they much too light for the heart of the matter.
These good fellows will bring you to where I am.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are still going to England.
I have much to tell you about them.
Goodbye.
He that you knows you, HAMLET.
Then you can direct me To him you delivered them for. 
Now you must see that I am not guilty, And you must put me in your heart as a friend, Since you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That man who killed your noble father Wanted to kill me.
It seems to be the truth.
but tell me Why didn’t you take action against these things, So full of crime and punishable by death, As you mainly were upset By concern for your safety, wisdom, if nothing else.
O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem a bit cowardly, But yet to me they are strong.
The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks, and for myself, Whether it’s my virtue or my plague, She's so necessary to my life and soul, That, as the star moves only in his orbit, I couldn’t do anything without her say-so.
The other motive, why I couldn’t go to a public court, Is the great love the people of this country have for him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turn wood to stone, Convert his crimes to graces, so that my actions, Not at all popular with the masses, Would have reflected badly on me, And not be taken as I intended them.
And so I have lost a noble father, A sister driven into insanity, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood as a challenger to the most beautiful woman of all Time for her perfections.
but my revenge will come.
Don’t lose any sleep over it.
You mustn’t think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our power be shaken with danger, And think it unimportant.
You will soon hear more.
What news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This one to your majesty, this one to the queen.
From Hamlet!
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say, I didn’t see them.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us alone.
High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
What does this mean?
Are all the rest returning?
Or is it some trick and no such thing?
Do you recognize the writing?
It’s Hamlet's handwriting.
I have no idea, my lord.
But let him come.
How can it be otherwise?
Yes, my lord, Just as long as you don’t ask me to forget about it.
Only to your own satisfaction.
It’s falling into place.
You have been talked about since your travel so much, For a quality where, they say, you really shine.
All your parts together Didn’t arouse such jealousy in him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Is his weak spot.
What part is that, my lord?
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, But necessary too, for youth doesn’t look less well in The fun and reckless clothes that it wears Than old age settles for his black furs and woolens, Showing health and seriousness.
Two months ago, There was a gentleman from Normandy here, I’ve seen myself, and served against the French, And they can do well on horseback, but this gallant Had witchcraft in it.
He grew into his seat, And had his horse do such wonderful things, As if he had been absorbed into the horse’s body With the brave beast.
He so impressed me, That I, through lies and tricks, Didn’t waste time in finding out what he did.
A Norman, was it?
A Norman.
I swear, Lamond.
The very same.
I know him well.
He is the jewel, indeed, And gem of the whole nation.
Sir, this report of his Poisoned Hamlet with envy That he couldn’t do anything but wish and beg Your sudden coming over her to play with him.
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Not that I think you didn’t love your father, But because I know love is begun by time, And I see, in the ways of love, That time dampens the spark and fire of it.
Within the very flame of love, there lives A kind of wick or snuff that will put it out, And nothing is worse than goodness staying still, For goodness, growing to an infectious flu, Dies in his own too much.
What we want to do, We should do when we would, for this 'would' changes, And has stoppages and delays as many As there are voices, hands, accidents, And then this 'should' is like the sigh of a spendthrift, That hurts by easing up.
But to the heart of the matter.
Hamlet comes back.
What would you do To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words?
To cut his throat in the church.
Murder, indeed, should not be a church activity, because Then revenge should have no bounds.
When Hamlet returns, he shall know you’re Home.
We'll start rumors that praise your excellence And exaggerate the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you together in the end, And place bets on your fight.
He, being weak, Most generous, and free from all trickery, Will not think about swords, so that easily, Or with a little mix up, you may choose A sword that’s not poisoned, and, in a pass during Practice, kill him in revenge for your father.
I’ll do it.
And for that purpose, I’ll poison my sword.
I bought an oil of a mountebank, So mortal that, only dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood, no super-potion so rare, Collected from all antidotes under the moon That have always worked, can save the thing from death And this is only with a scratch.
I’ll touch the point of my sword with this poison so that, if I touch him slightly, It will kill him.
Therefore this project should have a plan B or C, that might hold if this first one failed.
Hang on!
Let me think.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, I have it!
While you’re moving around and you are hot and dry, Since you’ll make your bouts more violent to that purpose, and he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared a Goblet for him for that purpose, so that even only sipping, If he escapes your stick of venom by luck, We can be successful this way.
What now, sweet queen!
One sorrow walks on the heels of another, Following too fast.
Your sister's drowned, Laertes.
Drowned!
O, where?
Alas, then she is drowned?
Drowned, drowned.
You had too much water, poor Ophelia, And therefore I’ll hold back my tears, but It is still our trick, nature holds her habits, Let shame say what it will.
When these tears are gone, Woman will be extinct.
Farewell, my lord.
I have a rumor of fire, that I would gladly spread, Before this news puts the fire out.
Let's follow him, Gertrude,.
I had all I could do to calm his anger!
Now I fear this will make it start all over again, Therefore let's follow him. 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell you she is, and therefore make her grave straight.
The coroner has decided, and finds it Christian burial.
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?
Why, that’s the coroner’s finding.
It must be self-offense.
It can’t be anything else.
Here lies the water, good.
Here stands the man, good.
But is this law?
Yes, by Mary, it’s the coroner’s inquest law.
Will you know the truth about it?
If this hadn’t been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried without a Christian burial.
Why, there you’ve said it.
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than another Christian.
Come, my spade.
There are no old gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They hold up Adam's profession.
Was he a gentleman?
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Why, he had none.
What, are you a pagan?
How do you understand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another question to you.
The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
I like your joke, I swear.
Do it again, come on.
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?
Yes, tell me that, and stop my guessing.
By Mary, now I can tell.
Do it.
Mass, I cannot tell.
Go, get you to Johann, bring me a mug of whiskey.
In youth when I did love, did love, I thought it was very sweet, To contract, O, the time for, ah, my reason, O, I thought there was nothing meet.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-digging?
Habit has made it a property of easiness in him.
That’s true.
The one that doesn’t work has the more delicate sense.
But age, with his stealing steps, Has clawed me in his clutch, And has shipped me until the land, As if I had never been such.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.
How the man jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!
This might be the head of a politician, which this ass now reaches over one that would go around God, might it not?
It might, my lord.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How are you, good lord?
This might be my lord so-and-so, that praised my lord such-and-such's horse when he meant to ask for it, might it not?
Yes, my lord.
Why, even so.
and now my Lady Worm's, no jaw and knocked about the face with a sexton's spade.
Here's fine turnaround, if we were able to see it.
Did these bones cost no more the making of them but to play at games with them?
Mine ache to think about it.
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet, Oe a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is ptoper.
There's another.
why can’t that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where are his arguments now, his pens, his cases, his subpoenas, and his tricks?
Why does he allow this rude fellow to knock him about the head now, with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him why he’s being hit?
Hum!
This fellow might have been a great buyer of land in his time, with his statutes, his emblems, his fine art, his double billing, his house seizures?
Is this the finest of his fine art, and the seizure of his house seizures, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt?
Will his billing bill him no more for his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens?
The very transfers of his lands will scarcely lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, huh?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Isn’t parchment made of sheep-skins?
Yes, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.
I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave is this, sir?
Mine, sir.
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
I think it’s yours indeed, for you lie in it.
You lie out of it, sir, and therefore it’s not yours.
For my part, I don’t lie in it, yet it ‘s mine.
You do lie in it, to be in it and say it is yours.
It is for the dead, not for the quick, therefore you lie.
It is a quick lie, sir, it will go away again from me to you.
What man dot you dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman then?
For none neither.
Who is to be buried in it?
One that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolutely clever this chap is!
We must speak by the book or lying will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he hurts his feelings.
How long have you been a grave-maker?
Of all the days in the year, I became a grave-maker the day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Can’t you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born, he that is crazy and sent into England.
Yes, by Mary, why was he sent to England?
He shall get his mind back there, or, if he doesn’t, it's no great problem there.
Why?
It will not be seen in him there.
There the men are as crazy as he is.
How did he become crazy?
Very strangely, they say.
How strangely?
Actually, even by losing his mind.
On what grounds?
Why, here in Denmark.
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie in the earth before he rots?
Well, if he’s not rotten before he dies, as we have many small pox corpses nowadays that will scarce last beyond the wake, he will last you some eight years or nine years.
A tanner will last you nine years.
Why he more than another?
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body.
Here's a skull now.
This skull has been buried three-and-twenty years.
Whose was it?
A bastard, crazy fellow's it was.
Whose do you think it was?
No, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a crazy rogue!
He poured a pint of Rhine wine on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
This one?
Just that one.
Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite fun, of most excellent imagination.
I want to vomit.
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I don’t know how many times.
Where are your jokes now?
Your games?
Your songs?
Your flashes of laughter that always make the audience roar?
No one now, to mock your own grinning?
Quite jaw-fallen?
I beg you, Horatio, tell me one thing.
What's that, my lord?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this in the earth?
Yuck!
Just like that, my lord.
What common uses we may return to, Horatio!
Why can’t imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander until he finds it stopping a wine barrel?
It’s thinking about it too much to think like that.
Emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
O, that the earth which kept the world in fear Should patch a wall to expel the winter's cold!
But quiet!
Who is that they’re following?
And with such shortened rites?
This shows that The corpse they follow did, with a desperate hand, Commit suicide.
It was of some nobility.
Let’s hide and listen.
What other ceremony?
That is Laertes, A very noble youth.
Look.
What other ceremony?
Her funeral rites have been as far enlarged As we can enlarge.
Isn’t there more be done?
Lay her in the earth, And may violets spring from her fair And unpolluted flesh!
I tell you, churlish priest, My sister shall be a ministering angel When you lie howling.
What, the fair Ophelia?
Sweets to the sweet.
farewell.
I hoped you would have been my Hamlet's wife, I thought to have decorated your bride-bed, sweet maid, And not your grave.
O, three times sorrow Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed deprived you of your most wonderful Intelligence!
Stop the burial a while, Until I hold her once more in mine arms.
Now bury the living and dead, Until you have made a mountain from this flat earth To be higher than the mountain of Italy or the skyish head Of blue Mount Olympus.
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take your soul!
You don’t pray well.
I beg you, take your fingers from my throat, For, although I am not impatient and rash, I still have something dangerous in me, Which you should fear.
Take away your hand!
Separate them.
Gentlemen!
My good lord, be quiet.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer blink.
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia!
Forty thousand brothers Couldn’t, even with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.
What will you do for her?
O, he is crazy, Laertes.
For love of God, leave him alone!
God’s wounds, show me what you'll do.
I’ll do it.
Be buried quickly with her, and so will I.
And, if you babble about mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, until our ground, Singeing his head against the burning sun, Make the highest mountain like a wart!
No, if you’ll Speak, I’ll rant as well as you.
Eventually, as patient as the female dove When that her golden twins are discovered, His silence will sit drooping.
I always loved you.
But it’s not important.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and every dog will have his day.
Good Gertrude, put a guard over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument.
So much for this, sir.
Now as for the other thing, You do remember all the circumstances?
Remember it, my lord!
Sir, there was a kind of fighting in my heart That wouldn’t let me sleep.
I thought I lay Worse than in a rebellion, in the chains.
such ghosts and goblins in my life, That, on my arrival, without any delay, No, not even to wait for the grinding of the axe, My head should be chopped off.
Is it possible?
But will you listen to how I proceeded?
Go ahead..
Being surrounded like this with evil plans, Before I could start thinking about it, before They could execute the plan, I sat myself down, Though up a new order, wrote it just like the original.
I used to think, as our politicians do, A sin to make a forgery and worked hard at How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me a useful service.
Do you want to know The effect of what I wrote?
Yes, good my lord.
An earnest oath from the king, As England was his faithful ally, As love between them might flourish like the palm tree, As peace should still wear her wheaten garland And stand like a comma between their friendships, And many “as-es” like that of great emotion, That, on the view and knowledge of these contents, Without further discussion, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not even allowing time for confession and penance.
How was this sealed?
Why, even in that was heaven good to me.
Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, and what followed You know already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to it.
Why, man, they did make love to this job.
Their defeat Grew by their own actions.
It is dangerous when the lower nature comes Between the ups and downs Of mighty opposites.
Why, what a king is this!
Doesn’t it, do you thank, become my responsibility to kill He that has killed my king, and whored my mother, Push himself in between the election and my hope to be King, tried to kill me, And with such knowledge, isn’t it perfect duty To kill him with this arm?
and isn’t it to be damned To let this canker of our nature do Further evil?
The time between is mine, And a man's life is longer than it takes to say “One.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That I forgot myself to Laertes, Because, by the image of my cause, I can see Myself in him.
I’ll court his favors.
But, for sure, the bravery of his grief put me Into a towering passion.
Quiet, who’s coming here?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Do you know this water-fly?
No, my good lord.
Your state is the more gracious, for it is a vice to know him.
He has much fertile land.
Let a beast be lord of beasts, and his cattle shall stand at the king's dinner table.
He’s a clown, but, as I say, proud to own dirt.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were not busy, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
I will listen very carefully.
Put your hat to its right use.
It is for the head.
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
No, believe me, it is very cold, the wind is northerly.
It is unusually cold, my lord, indeed.
I think it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry, I can’t tell how.
But, my lord, his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head.
Sir, here Laertes is newly come to court, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent traits, of very soft manners and looking great.
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, because you shall find in him the continent of what a gentleman is.
Sir, his refinement suffers no lie from you, although, I know, to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic, and yet not off course, in regard to his quick sail.
But, in the truth of praise, I take him to be a soul of great note, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true talk of him, he is what you see, and whoever copies him, is his shadow, nothing more.
Your lordship speaks most truly of him.
The concern sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath?
Sir?
Isn’t it possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do it, Sir, really.
What about the naming of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
Of him, sir.
Well, sir.
I mean, sir, for his weapon, but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his skill, he has no equal.
What's his weapon?
Sword and dagger.
That's two of his weapons.
but never mind.
What do you call the carriages?
I knew you must be aware of the margin before you had finished.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
But, on.
Why is this all wagered, as you call it?
What if I say no?
I mean, my lord, the fight of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.
If it please his majesty, it is the relaxing time of day with me.
Shall I re-deliver your answer like that?
With my meaning, sir, however you want to say it.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
He does well to praise himself, because no one else will praise him.
A just hatched bird runs away with eggshell on his head.
He did comply with his mother’s breast before he sucked it.
He has, and many more just like him that I know the worthless age dotes on, are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style, a kind of swollen collection, which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst.
My lord, his majesty sent a message to you by young Osric, who tells him that you will meet him in the hall.
He want to know if will play with Laertes now, or whether you will take a longer time.
I am true to my intentions; they follow the king's pleasure.
If he is ready now, I am too, now or whenever, provided that I am so able as I am now.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you start to play.
She instructs me well.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I don’t think so.
Since he went to France, I have been in constant practice.
I shall win at the odds.
But you wouldn’t know what a bad feeling I have inside.
But it doesn’t matter.
No, my good lord, It’s only foolishness, but it is such a kind of misgiving as would maybe trouble a woman.
If you have a gut feeling, obey it.
Being ready is everything.
Since no man has anything of what he leaves, what is it to leave soon?
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give me your pardon, sir.
This King knows, and you must have heard, How I am punished with a painful madness.
What I have done That might deeply hurt your nature, honor, And complaints, I here proclaim was craziness.
Was it Hamlet who wronged Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
Who does it, then?
His madness.
Sir, before this audience, Let my denial of evil intent Give me immunity in your most generous thoughts As though I have shot my arrow over the house And hurt my brother.
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should move me the most To my revenge.
But in my terms of honor I hold back, and will make no reconciliation Until, by some elder masters of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name unbloody.
But until that time, I receive your offered love like love, And won’t do it wrong.
I accept it freely, And will play this brother's wager honestly.
Give us the swords, come on.
Come, one for me.
I’ll be your mirror, Laertes.
In my ignorance, Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night, be shown to its fiery advantage indeed.
You mock me, sir.
No, honestly.
Give them the swords, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
I have seen you both, But since he's gotten better, we have, therefore, odds.
I like this one.
All these swords have a length?
Yes, my good lord.
Set up the goblets of wine for me on that table.
If Hamlet gives the first or second hit, Or quits in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements fire their ammunition, The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, And in the cup he shall throw a pearl, Richer than that which four successive kings Have worn in Denmark's crown.
Give me the cups, And let the kettle drum speak to the trumpet, The trumpet to the cannon man outside, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin.
And you, the judges, watch carefully.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judges?
A hit, a hit that was felt.
OK, again.
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is your, Here's to your health.
Give him the cup.
I’ll play this bout first, put it aside a while.
Come on.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.
He's fat, and out of breath.
The queen drinks to your fortune, Hamlet.
Good madam!
Gertrude, don’t drink.
I will, my lord, I beg you to pardon me.
It is the poisoned cup; it is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam, by and by.
Come, let me wipe your face.
My lord, I’ll hit him now.
I don’t think so.
And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Come, for the third, Laertes.
You say so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
I’ll attack you now!
Part them.
They are in a rage.
Look to the queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides.
How are you, my lord?
How are you, Laertes?
Why, as a woodpecker caught in my own trap, Osric.
I am justly killed with my own wickedness.
How is the Queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.
No, no!
I am poisoned.
O villainy!
Ho!
Let the doors be locked.
Wickedness!
Find it!
It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, you are killed, No medicine in the world can save you.
The evil deed Has turned itself on me.
Behold, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Your mother's poisoned.
I can do no more.
The King, the King's to blame.
The point poisoned too!
Then, venom, do your work.
Treason!
Treason!
O, still defend me, friends!
I am only hurt.
Here, you incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink this potion.
Is your marriage here?
Follow my mother.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
And I am not guilty of yours.
Heaven forgive you for it!
I follow you.
I am dead, Horatio.
Wretched queen, goodbye!
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Here's some poison wine still left.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name that is, Things left unknown like this, shall live after me!
If you ever did hold me in your heart, Stay away from happy things for a while, And, in this harsh world, draw your breath in pain To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
Young Fortinbras, after conquering Poland, Gives this warlike volley To the ambassadors of England.
I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do predict that the throne belongs To Fortinbras.
Now a noble heart breaks.
Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing you to your rest!
Why does the drum come here?
Where is this sight?
What do you want to see?
If anything of sorrow or wonder, stop your search.
This scene is chaotic.
O proud death, What feast is being held in your eternal cell, That you have killed so many princes So bloodily all at the same time?
The sight is sad, And our affairs come too late from England.
The ears that should give us hearing can’t hear, To tell him his order is obeyed, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Who will thank us?
No thanks from his mouth, If it were alive to thank you.
He never gave orders for their deaths.
But since, you from the Polack wars, and you from England, are here arrived, and so jump on this bloody Question, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about.
So you shall hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths planned by cunning and false causes, And, in this result, mistaken motives Fallen on the planners' heads.
I can truly deliver All this.
Let us hurry to hear it, And call the noblest to hear it too.
As for me, I embrace my fortune with sorrow.
I have some rights of past history in this kingdom, Which now invites me to claim my place.
I shall also have cause to speak of that, And directly from his mouth whose voice will deliver it.
But let this speaking be done now, Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the platform, For he was likely, had he been King, To have proved most royal, and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war will Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies.
Away!
Go home, you idle creatures, go home!
Why, sir, I’m a carpenter.
Where is your leather apron and your ruler?
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine worker, I’m only, as you would say a cobbler.
But what’s your trade?
Just tell me that.
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a clear conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
What’s your trade, you deceitful man?
You naughty, Deceitful man, what’s your trade?
No, Please, sir, don’t be angry with me; yet, if you’re angry, sir, I can mend you.
What do you mean by that?
Mend me, you rude fellow!
Yes, sir, mend you.
You’re a mender, are you?
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the sharp little tool; I don’t stick my nose into any tradesman's matters, or women's matters, but with awl.
I’m indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they’re in great danger, I re-cover them.
Many proper men that ever walked on cowhide leather have walked on my work.
But why aren’t you in your shop today?
Why do you lead these men in the streets?
Truly, sir, so I can wear out their shoes to get myself more work.
But, really, sir, we have taken a holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
Why rejoice?
What conquest does he bring home?
What people who pay him tribute follow him to Rome, To decorate his chariot’s wheels with their chains and bonds?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, Didn’t you know Pompey?
Many times, You’ve climbed up to the walls and lookout posts, To the towers and windows, yes, to chimney tops, Your infants in your arms, and you’ve sat there The entire day, waiting patiently To see great Pompey pass through the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot appear, Haven’t you made one great big shout that was so loud The Tiber River trembled underneath her banks To hear the echo of your sounds That bounced off her hollow shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And now you decide to call a holiday?
And now you throw flowers in the way if the man That comes in triumph over Pompey's death?
Get going!
Run to your houses, fall on your knees, Pray to the gods to stop the plague That must be the punishment for this ingratitude.
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this mistake, Get all the poor men like you together, Bring them to the Tiber River’s banks and weep your tears Into the water, until the lowest stream Floods the highest shores of heaven.
See whether they’ll really do what you suggested; Their guilt made them vanish in silence.
You go down that way towards the Capitol; I’ll go this way.
May we do that?
You know it is the feast of the priest Lupercus.
It doesn’t matter; don’t let the statues Be hung with Caesar's trophies.
I'll go around And drive the low people away from the streets; You do this too, where you see many of them gathered together.
Caesar speaks.
Stand directly in Antony’s way, When he runs his course.—Antony,— Caesar, my lord?
I’ll remember.
When Caesar says, "Do this," I do it.
Go on, and don’t leave any ritual out.
Caesar!
Ha!
Who calls?
Everyone, quiet.— Peace!
Who’s calling for me?
I hear a voice that is more shrill than all the music Yelling, "Caesar"!
Beware the Ides of March.
Who is that man?
A man who can tell the future is telling you to beware March 15.
Bring him here; let me see his face.
Fellow, come here; look at Caesar.
What do you say to me now?
Speak again.
Beware the Ides of March.
He’s a dreamer; let’s get away from him.
Let’s go.
Will you go see the order of the winners of the race?
I don’t like games; I lack some part Of that quick spirit that Antony has.
Don’t let me hold you up, Cassius, go if you like; I'll leave you.
You’re too stubborn and too strange To your friend that loves you.
I’m annoyed lately With different passions, Ideas that only I can know, Which are perhaps seen in my behavior; But don’t let my good friends be upset— Cassius, you’re one of them— Or try to understand my indifference any further Than that poor Brutus, at war with himself, Forgets to show friendship to other men.
Then, Brutus, I have really misunderstood your passions, Which is why this my heart has forgotten Thoughts of great value, worthy thoughts.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
No, Cassius, because the eye can only see itself In a mirror or by some other thing like it.
And it’s very much lamented, Brutus, That you don’t have any mirrors that will Let you see your own hidden worthiness, Any mirrors that you might let you see your shadow.
I have heard that many of the best-respected men in Rome,— Except immortal Caesar!— speak about Brutus, And groaning underneath the political burden of this age, Have wished that noble Brutus could see what they see.
What dangers would you lead me into, Cassius, That you want me to search for something That I don’t have in myself?
For that reason, good Brutus, get ready to hear what I have to say; And since you know you can’t see yourself Except in a mirror, I’ll be your mirror, And will modestly let you see That in yourself which you don’t know about.
And don’t be angry with me, gentle Brutus; I wish I were a common comedian, or used To urinating on my friendship with ordinary oaths To every new opponent; if you know That I show false friendship to some men, and hug them hard And after that, tell lies about them, or if you know That I profess myself at feasts to be friends with The entire place, then think about me dangerous.
What does this shouting mean?
I’m afraid the people Are going to choose Caesar for their king.
Yes, you fear it?
Then I must think you wouldn’t want it.
What do you want to tell me?
I know you’ve that virtue, Brutus, As well as I know your face.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I can’t tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for myself alone, I would rather not live to be In awe of such a thing as I’m.
And indeed he did so.
And now this man Has become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature, and must bow, Even if Caesar only nods at him carelessly.
He had a fever when he was in Spain, And, when the fit was on him, I noticed How he shook.
I heard him groan.
Another general shout!
I believe that this applause is For some new honors that are to be heaped on Caesar.
Why, man, he stands on top of the narrow world Like the Colossus of Rhodes, and we little men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves disgraceful graves.
Brutus" and "Caesar.” What is in that name, "Caesar?
Why should that name be sounded any more than yours?
Write them down together; your name is just as good; Say them out loud; your name sounds just as good; Think about their importance, yours is just as important; Use them to contact ghosts, "Brutus" will bring a spirit As soon as "Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once, What meat does this our Caesar eat That he’s grown so great?
Age, shame on you!
Rome, there are no more people of noble bloods in you!
Has there ever been any age since Noah and the flood That was not famous because of more than one man?
When could they say, until now, those that talked about Rome, That her wide walls were ruled by only one man?
Is Rome still Rome, and does it have room enough, When there is in it only one man?
O, you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have fought The eternal devil to keep his status in Rome, As easily as he would fight a king!
I’m not angry that you’re my friend; As for what you’re persuading me to do, I have some plans.
I’ll tell you later what I’ve thought about this And about these times,; for now, Please don’t to try to persuade me any further.
I’ll think about what you’ve said; I’ll patiently hear what you’ve to say, and find a time When I can both meet with you to hear and answer such high things.
I’m glad that my weak words Have brought out this show of fire from Brutus.
The games are finished, and Caesar is returning.
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve; And he’ll, in his sour way, tell you What notable events have happened today.
Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with the same beady and fiery eyes That we have seen on him in the Capitol, When some senators disagreed with him in a meeting.
Casca will tell us what’s wrong.
Antonius,— Caesar?
Don’t be afraid of him, Caesar; he's not dangerous; He’s a noble Roman and has a good disposition.
I wish he were fatter!
He reads a lot; He’s a great observer, and actually he looks Through the deeds of men.
Such men as he is are never at ease in their hearts When they see a man greater than themselves; And for that reason they are very dangerous.
I would rather tell you what to be afraid of More than what I am afraid of, for I’m always Caesar.
Come over here my right side, because I am deaf in this ear, And tell me what you really think of him.
You pulled my sleeve; do you want to speak with me?
Yes, Casca, tell us what has happened today That makes Caesar look so sad.
Why, you were with him, weren’t you?
If I was, then I shouldn’t ask Casca what had happened.
Why, there was a crown offered to him, and when it was Offered to him, he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this, And then the people started shouting.
What was the second noise for?
Why, for that too.
They shouted three times.
What was the last cry for?
Why, for that too.
Was the crown offered to him three times?
Yes, damn it, it was, and he pushed it aside three times, Every time more gently than the last, and at each pushing aside, My honest neighbors shouted.
Who offered him the crown?
Why, Antony.
Tell us how it happened, gentle Casca.
I may as well be hanged as to tell how it happened.
It was merely a joke; I didn’t pay attention to it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown;—yet it wasn’t a crown either, it was one of these large hats;—and, as I told you, he pushed it aside once.
but, for all that, to my thinking, he seemed eager to have it.
but, to my thinking, he was very reluctant to remove his fingers off it.
And then he was offered it the third time; he pushed it aside the third time, and still, as he refused it, the crowd shouted, and clapped their rough hands, and threw their sweaty night hats into the air, and uttered such a great deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown, that the smell almost choked Caesar, because he fainted and fell down from it.
And, for mine part, I didn’t dare laugh for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the bad air.
What, did Caesar faint?
He fell down in the market place, foamed at the mouth, and was speechless.
No, Caesar doesn’t have it; but you, and I, And honest Casca, we have epilepsy.
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.
If the common people didn’t applaud him and hiss at him, since he pleased and displeased them, as they used to do to the actors in the theatre, then I’m not really a man.
What said he when he came to?
Damn it, before he fell down, when he thought the common herd was glad he had refused the crown, he opened his shirt, and offered to cut his throat.
When he came to again, he said, if he had done or said anything out of order, he wanted the people to think it was his infirmity.
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done the same thing.
And, after that he came, away sad?
Yes.
Did Cicero say anything?
Yes, he spoke in Greek.
How did that work?
Goodbye.
There was more nonsense, if I could only remember it.
Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca?
No, I’ve got another engagement.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Yes, if I’m alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
Good, I’ll expect you.
What a blunt fellow he’s turned out to be!
He was becoming very spirited when he was in school.
So he is now in getting any bold or Noble job done; However, he pretends to be slow in nature.
This rudeness is the topping to his good traits, Which lets men accept his words With better understanding.
And so it is.
I’ll leave you now.
Tomorrow, if you want to speak with me, I’ll come to your house; or, if you like, Come to my house, and I’ll wait for you.
OK, that’s fine.
Tonight, I will throw writings in his windows, All tending to the great opinion that Rome holds his name, by several different hands, as if they came from several citizens, In these writings, I will analyze, although obscurely, Caesar's ambition.
And after this, let Caesar sit more securely on his throne, Because we will shake him from there, or endure worse days. 
Good evening, Casca.
Did you bring Caesar home?
Why are you breathless, and why are you staring like that?
Aren’t you moved, when the entire earth Is shaking uncontrollably?
Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world has been too impudent with the gods, Incensing them to send destruction.
Why, have you seen anything more wonderful?
A common slave—you’d know him well by sight— Held up his left hand, which flamed and burned Like twenty torches all together, and yet his hand, Not feeling any fire, wasn’t even scorched.
Besides,—I haven’t used my sword since— I met a lion, in front of the Capitol, Who glared at me, and angrily passed me by, Without attacking me, and there were a hundred ghastly Women gathered in a heap, Transformed by their fear; who swore they saw Men, all on fire, walking up and down the streets.
And yesterday, the night bird sat In the marketplace, in the middle of the day, Howling and shrieking.
When these omens All happen at the same time, don’t let men say "These things have their reasons; they’re natural," For I believe they’re warning signs That predict the climate that they point to.
Indeed, time has a strange disposition But men may interpret things in whatever way they like, Far from the purpose of the things themselves.
Does Caesar come to the Capitol tomorrow?
He does, because he asked Antonius to Send word to you that he would be there tomorrow.
Good then, Casca.
This disturbed sky Isn’t one to walk in.
Goodbye, Cicero.
Who's there?
A Roman.
Casca, I can tell by your voice.
You have a good ear.
Cassius, what night this is!
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens could be so threatening?
Those men that know the earth is full of faults.
For my part, I have walked about the streets, Giving in to the dangerous night; And, undressed like this, Casca, as you can see, I have bared my chest to the thunder bolts; And when the angry, blue lightning seemed to openThe chest of heaven, I put myself Even in the direction and the very flash of it.
But why did you tempt the sky like that?
It is part of men to be afraid and tremble When the most mighty gods send Lightening to astonish us.
You’re not too sharp, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman, you want, Or else, you don’t use what you have.
You look pale and dazed, And put on fear and make yourself wonder, To see the strange behavior of the Heavens.
But if you would think about the true cause, Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind; Why old men, fools, and children think about it— Why all these things change from their usual order, Change their natures, and their normal events To monstrous disorder—why, you shall find That Heaven has infused the lightening with these spirits, To make them instruments of fear and warning About some monstrous state.
Now I could, Casca, Name a man to you that is most like this dreadful night, One that thunders, send lightening, opens graves, and roars, As the lion in the Capitol does; A man no mightier in personal action; Than you or I, yet he’s grown monstrous, And fearful, just as these strange eruptions are.
It’s Caesar that you mean, isn’t it, Cassius?
our fathers' minds are dead, And we are governed by our mothers' spirits; Our burden and suffering makes us look womanish.
Indeed they say that the senators Mean to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow,And that he will be king everywhere, In every place, except here in Italy.
In that event, you gods, you make the weak the strongest; In that event, you gods, you defeat tyrants.
No stony tower, no walls of beaten brass, No airless dungeon, no strong chains of iron Can hold the strength of the spirit; But life, tired of these worldly bars, Never lacks the power to kill itself.
If I know this, and know the whole world too, I can shake off at pleasure That part of tyranny that I endure.
I can too.
And so every slave has in his own hand The power to cancel his captivity.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf, But he sees that the Romans are nothing but sheep.
He wouldn’t be a lion if Romans weren’t female deer.
Those that are in a hurry will make a mighty fire and Start it with flimsy straws.
What trash Rome is, What rubbish, and what garbage, when it serves As the fuel to start a fire that will throw light On so vile a thing as Caesar!
But, O grief, Where have you taken me?
Perhaps I say this Before a willing slave.
Stay, take my hand.
Be a rebel for revenge for all these problems, And I’ll support you as far As the man who goes the farthest.
It’s a deal.
Now you know, Casca, I have already persuaded Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To join me in an undertaking Of honorable/dangerous consequence; And I know by this, they are waiting for me In Pompey's Porch.
For now, because of this fearful night, There’s no noise or walking in the streets, And the weather reflects The work we have at hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
Stand next to me for a while, because someone is coming hastily.
To find you.
Who's that?
Metellus Cimber?
No, it is Casca, one who agrees With our attempts.
Isn’t someone waiting for me, Cinna?
I’m glad about it.
What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us who have seen strange sights.
Isn’t someone waiting for me?
Tell me.
Yes, They are.
O Cassius, if you could only persuade The noble Brutus to join us— Don’t worry.
When you’ve done all that, Go to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone To your house to find you.
Well, I’ll get going And so deliver these papers as you asked me.
Three parts of him Are ours already, and, at our next meeting, The whole man will be ours.
You’ve judge his worth, and our great need of him, Very well.
Let’s go, Because it is after midnight, and, before day, We’ll wake him up, and be sure that he’s with us. 
Wake up, I say!
Hey, Lucius!
You called, my lord?
Light a candle in my study, Lucius.
When it is lit, come back and call me here.
I will, my lord.
He must die, and, for my part, I don’t know a personal cause to throw at him, But for the general complaints.
A bright day brings out the black, poison snake, And that means we must walk carefully.
Crown him?— that.
And then, I admit, he may do danger, at his will, with A sting that we put in him.
The abuse of greatness is when it disconnects Remorse from power, and, to speak truth about Caesar, I haven’t known a time when his emotions were swayed More than his reason.
The candle burns in your bedroom, sir.
Searching the window for a match, I found This paper sealed up like this, and I’m sure It wasn’t there when I went to bed.
Go back to bed; it isn’t day.
Isn’t tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?
I don’t know, sir.
Look at the calendar, and come back and tell me.
I will, sir.
The vapors, whizzing in the air Give off so much light that I can read by them.— "Brutus, you sleep.
Wake up and see yourself.
Wake up!—" Such instigations have often been dropped Where I have picked them up.
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?
What, Rome?
My ancestors drove Tarquin from the streets of Rome When he was called a king.— "Speak, strike, revenge!
Am I begged, then,To speak and strike?
O Rome, I promise you, If revenge follows, you will receive Everything you ask for at the hand of Brutus!
Sir, it’s the fifteenth day of March.
Good.
Sir, it’s your brother, Cassius, at the door, Who wants to see you.
Is he alone?
No, sir, there are more with him.
Do you know them?
No, sir, their hats are drawn over their ears, And half their faces are buried in their cloaks, So that I couldn’t tell from their clothes or faces Who any of them are.
They’re the rebels.—O conspiracy, Shame on you for showing your dangerous eyes by night When evils are most free?
O, then, by day Where will you find a cavern dark enough To hide your monstrous face?
Don’t find any, conspiracy; Hide it in smiles and friendliness, Because, if you pass, your real face on, Not even the dark place between heaven and hell itself Is dim enough to hide you from being stopped.
I think we are too bold to interrupt your sleep.
Good morning, Brutus; are we troubling you?
Do I know these men that come along with you?
Yes, every one of them, and every man here Respects you, and every one wishes You had that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman has for you.
This is Trebonius.
He’s welcome here.
This, Decius Brutus.
He’s welcome too.
This, Casca; this, Cinna, and this, Metellus Cimber.
They’re all welcome.— What worries are keeping you From sleeping?
May I have a word with you?
This direction is east.
Doesn’t the day break here?
No.
O, pardon, sir, it does, and the gray lines over there That adorn the clouds are the messengers of dawn.
You’ll see that you’re both wrong.
Here, where I point my sword, the Sun rises, Which is going a great way to the South, Bringing in spring.
Some two months away, up higher toward the North, He first shines, and the high East Stands, just as the Capitol, directly here.
Let’s shake hands all over again, one by one.
And let’s swear our determination.
No, not an oath.
If not the face of men, The suffering of our souls, the waste of time— If these motives are weak, let’s break it off now, And every man go away to his lazy rest, Let high-sighted tyranny range on Until each man drops by chance.
But if these events, As I’m sure they do, bear fire enough To kindle cowards, and to harden The melting spirits of women with valor, then, countrymen, What do we need any other motivation except our own causeTo prod us to revenge?
What other bonds Than secret Romans, that have spoken the word, And will not negotiate without honor?
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty promised That this promise shall be, or we will die for it?
Swear priests and cowards, and deceitful men, Old feeble dead bodies and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; swear to bad causes that Such creatures as men doubt, but don’t stain The even goodness of our undertaking, or the unsuppressed character of our spirits, To think that our cause and our performance Need oaths, when every drop of blood That every Roman carries, and carries nobly, Is guilty of causing the birth of several bastards, If he breaks the smallest particle Of any promise that he has made.
But what about Cicero?
Shall we check him out?
I think he’ll stand with us very strongly.
Let’s not leave him out.
No, by no means.
It shall be said that his judgment ruled our hands; Our youths and wildness won’t appear at all, But all be buried in his seriousness.
Then leave him out.
Indeed, he’s not fit.
Shall any other man be killed besides Caesar?
Our plan will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut off the head, and then hack off the arms and legs, Like anger in death and jealousy afterwards, Because Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And, in the spirit of men, there is no blood.
O, that we could come by Caesar's spirit then And not dismember Caesar!
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it!
This shall label Our purpose as necessary and not jealous, Which appearing to be respectful to common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, don’t think abut him, Because he can do no more than Caesar's arm can do When Caesar's head is cut off.
I still fear him, Because in the acquired love he bears to Caesar— Alas, good Cassius, don’t think of him.
If he loves Caesar, all that he can do Is what he can do to himself — think and die for Caesar.
And that’s as much he should do, because he’s given To sports, to wildness, and to having a lot of company.
The clock has struck three.
It’s time to leave.
But it is still doubtful Whether Caesar will come out today or not, Because he’s grown superstitious lately, Quite a distance from the main opinion he once held About fantasy, dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent signs, The unaccustomed weather of this night, And persuasion of his men who tell the future May keep him from the Capitol today.
Don’t be afraid of that.
I’ll work on this, Because I can give his state of mind true purpose, And I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
No, we’ll all be there to go get him.
By eight o’clock.
Is that the latest?
Let that be the latest, and be on time.
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, Who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder why none of you’ve thought about him.
Now, good Metellus, go ask him.
He likes me very well, and I have given him cause to; Just send him here, and I'll train him.
The morning is coming.
We'll leave you, Brutus;— And, friends, scatter yourselves, but all remember What you’ve said, and show yourselves to be true Romans.
Lucius!—Fast asleep?
You haven’t got dreams or fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men.
Brutus, my lord!
Portia, what are you doing?
Why are you up now?
It isn’t healthy to expose Your weak condition to the raw-cold morning like this.
Not for you either.
I asked you again, then you scratched your head, And stamped your foot very impatiently.
Still I insisted; still you didn’t answer, But, with an angry wave of your hand, You gave me a sign to leave you.
So I did, Fearing that I might make you more impatient When you seemed already fired up, and besides, I was hoping it was just a bad mood, Which sometimes hits every man.
It won’t let you eat, or talk, or sleep; And, if it could affect your face and body So much that it conquers your spirit, I shouldn’t know you, Brutus.
My dear lord, Please tell me the cause of your grief.
I’m not feeling well, and that’s all.
Brutus is wise, and, if he were not in good health, He would do something about it.
Why, I do.
Good Portia, go ahead to bed.
What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To challenge the evil diseases of the night, And tempt the thick and unclean air To add to his sickness?
No, my Brutus; You’ve got some sick worry on your mind, Which, by the right and virtue of my place, I ought to know of, and, on my knees, I order you, by my once commended beauty, By all your vows of love, and that marriage vow Which joined us and made us one, That you tell me, yourself, your half of me, Why you’re so depressed, and what men Have come to you tonight, because there have been Some six or seven here, who hid their faces Even from darkness.
Don’t kneel, gentle Portia.
I shouldn’t need to, if you were acting like gentle Brutus.
Inside the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is my knowing secrets that appertain to you An exception to our vows?
Am I part of you But, as it were, in sort or limitation,— To keep you company at meals, sleep in your bed, And talk to you sometimes?
Do I only live outside Of your good pleasure?
If it’s no more than this, Then Portia is Brutus' whore, not his wife.
You’re my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the red tears That visit my sad heart.
If this is true, then I should know this secret.
I’ll grant you that I’m a woman, but I am, besides, A woman that Lord Brutus married.
I’ll grant you that I’m a woman, but I am, besides, A woman of good reputation, Cato's daughter.
Do you think that I’m no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so married?
Tell me your secrets, I won’t reveal them.
I have given you strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh.
can I suffer that with patience But not my husband's secrets?
O you gods, Make me worthy of this noble wife!
Listen, listen, someone is knocking.
Portia, go in awhile, And by and by, your heart shall hear The secrets of my heart.
I’ll tell you all about my meetings, All the reasons for my sad brows.
Leave me quickly.
Lucius, who's knocking?
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
Allow a good morning from a feeble tongue.
I’m not sick, if Brutus have any exploit Worthy of the name of honor in hand.
I have such an exploit in hand, Ligarius, That you would hear if you weren’t sick.
By all the gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my sickness.
Soul of Rome!
Brave son, fathered from honorable loins!
You, like an exorcist, have brought my dead Spirit back to life.
Tell me to run now, And I’ll do impossible things, Yes, and get the better of them.
What needs to be done?
A piece of work that will make sick men well again.
But aren’t some well that we must make sick?
That we must do that also.
What it is, my Caius, I’ll tell you, as we are walking, As to whom it must be done.
Start walking, And I’ll follow you with a new, fired up heart, To do I don’t know what, but it’s enough That Brutus leads me on.
Follow me then. 
Neither heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Three times Calpurnia has cried out in her sleep, "Help, oh!
My lord?
Go tell the priests to do the sacrifice now, And bring me their opinions of success.
I will, my lord.
What do you mean, Caesar?
Do you intend to walk outside?
You shall not go out of your house today.
Caesar, I never believed in omens, Yet now they frighten me.
Besides the things that We have heard and seen, there is a man inside Recounting the most horrid sights seen by the guards.
A lioness has given birth in the streets; And graves have opened up and given up their dead; Fierce fiery warriors fight on the clouds, In ranks and squadrons and right forms of war, Which drizzled blood on the Capitol; The noise of battle screaming into the air, Horses neighed, and dying men groaned;And ghosts shrieked and squealed around the streets.
What we avoid When the mighty gods dictate how things go?
Still, Caesar shall go out, because these predictions Are not only for Caesar but also for the world in general.
Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant only taste of death once.
They say not to go out today.
Looking at the guts of an offering, They couldn’t find a heart inside the beast.
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart, If he stays at home today because he’s afraid.
No, Caesar shall not.
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence!
Don’t go out today.
Let me, on my knee, win this argument.
Mark Antony shall say I’m not well, And, to make you happy, I’ll stay home.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morning, worthy Caesar.
I come to go get you to the Senate-house.
And you’ve come at a very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators, And tell them that I can’t come today.
Tell them so, Decius.
Say he’s sick.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some reason, In case I’m laughed at when I tell them so.
But, for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I’ll let you know.
And these she interprets for warnings and portents And imminent evil, and on her knee, Has begged me to stay home today.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that, from you, great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall ask For tinctures, stains, relics, and recognition.
This is what Calpurnia’s dream means.
And in this way, you have explained it very well.
I have, when you’ve heard what I can say And you know it now.
The Senate has concluded To give a crown to mighty Caesar this day.
If you send them word you’ll not come, They may change their minds.
Besides, it’s might be Interpreted as silly, because someone says "Break up the Senate until another time, When Caesar's wife shall have better dreams.
Pardon me, Caesar; because my dear, dear love To your advancement bids me tell you this; And reason is responsible to my love.
How foolish your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I’m ashamed that I gave in to them.
Give me my robe, because I’ll go.
And look where Publius is coming to go get me.
Good morning, Caesar.
Caesar, it’s eight o'clock.
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Ask them prepare inside.
I’m to blame to be waited for like this.— Now, Cinna;—now, Metellus;—what, Trebonius!
Remember that you call on me today; Be near me so that I may remember you.
Caesar, I will.
and so near will I be, That your best friends shall wish I had been further away.
Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me; And we, like friends, will go ahead together straightaway.
That every “like” isn’t the same, O Caesar, That the heart of Brutus yearns to think about! 
Caesar, beware of Brutus; be careful of Cassius; don’t come near Casca; watch Cinna; don’t trust Trebonius; pay attention to Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus doesn’t love you; you’ve sinned against Caius Ligarius.
There is only one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.
If you’re not immortal, look around you.
Security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend you!
Boy, run to the Senate-house; Don’t wait to answer me, but get going.
What are you waiting for?
To know what my errand is, madam.
Set a huge mountain between my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
I didn’t hear anything, madam.
Please, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor, like a riot, And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
Really, madam, I hear nothing.
At mine own house, good lady.
What time is it?
Almost nine o’clock, lady.
Has Caesar gone to the Capitol?
Madam, not yet.
I’m going ahead to get my spot To see him pass on his way to the Capitol.
You’ve got some petition to Caesar, haven’t you?
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear what I have to say, I shall beg him to take care of himself.
Why, do you know if any harm's intended towards him?
None that I know definitely, but I’m very afraid there’s a chance.
Good morning to you.—Here the street is narrow.
The throng that follows Caesar at his heels, Of Senators, of Praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place with more space, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Come back to me again, And bring me word about what he says to you. 
The Ides of March are here.
Yes, Caesar, but not gone.
Hail, Caesar!
Read this petition.
Trebonius wants you to read this Humble suit at your leisure.
O Caesar, read mine first, because mine's a suit That touches Caesar nearer.
Read it, great Caesar.
What concerns ourselves shall be the last thing considered.
Don’t delay, Caesar; read it instantly.
What, is the fellow mad?
Servant, get away.
What, do you present your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
I wish your undertaking today may thrive.
What undertaking, Popilius?
Goodbye.
What did Popilius Lena say?
He wished that our undertaking today might thrive.
I’m afraid our plan has been discovered.
Look, how he gets Caesar’s attention.
Watch him.
If this is known, Cassius or Caesar shall never turn back, Because I’ll kill myself.
Cassius, stop worrying.
Popilius Lena doesn’t speak about our plan, Because, look, he smiles, and Caesar doesn’t notice anything.
Trebonius when to act, because, look, Brutus, He’s taking Mark Antony out of the way.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him come, And now tell Caesar what it is that he wants.
He’s ready; get closer and back him up.
Casca, you’re the first one to strike.
Are we All ready?
What’s the problem That Caesar and his Senate must fix?
Most high, most mighty, and most powerful Caesar, Metellus Cimber falls before you Most humbly.
I must stop you, Cimber.
These lying down and these lowly courtesies Might move ordinary men, And turn previous laws and the first decree Into the laws of children.
Don’t be so silly as To think that Caesar has such rebel blood That will be changed by The same things that change fools; I mean, sweet words, Low, crooked curtsies, and playing up to me like a puppy.
Your brother is banished by decree.
If you do bend, and pray, and play up to me for him, I reject you out of my way like a stray dog.
Caesar has never been wrong, only with good reason, And he will not be satisfied without good reason.
Is there any voice more worthy than mine To speak more sweetly into great Caesar's ear To ask for a repeal of my banished brother’s sentence?
What, Brutus?
Cassius falls as low as your foot, To beg freedom for Publius Cimber.
Speak, hands, for me!
You too, Brutus?— Then fall, Caesar!
Liberty!
Freedom!
Go ahead to the square, Brutus.
And Cassius too.
Where's Publius?
Here, quite confused by this mutiny.
Stand together solidly, for fear that some friend of Caesar's Should happen — Don’t talk about standing.—Publius, good cheer!
We don’t intend to harm you, Or any other Roman.
Tell them so, Publius.
And leave us, Publius for fear that the people Will attack us, doing some mischief to your old body.
Do so;— and let no man pay for this deed But we who did it.
Where's Antony?
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run, As it were doomsday.
Destiny, tell us what comes next.
We know we shall die, we know; it’s only time And drawing days out that men live on.
Why, he that spends twenty years fearing death Cuts twenty years off his life.
I agree, and then is death a benefit.
How many times will Caesar bleed in amusement, That lies now next to Pompey's statue, No worthier than the dust!
So often as that shall be, So often shall the group of us be called The men that gave their country liberty.
What, shall we go?
Yes, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will follow him With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Wait, who’s coming here?
A friend of Antony's.
If Brutus will guarantee that Antony May safely come to him and is ready to tell How Caesar deserved to die, Mark Antony shall love Brutus living Better than Caesar dead, and will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus with all true faith Thorough the hazards of this unconquered state.
That is what my master Antony says.
Your master is a wise and valiant Roman; I always thought so.
Tell him, if it pleases him come to this place, He shall get an explanation and, by my honor, Leave here safely.
I'll go get him now.
I know that we shall have him as a friend.
I hope that we may, but my heart is still Very much afraid of him, and my gut feeling is that He cannot be trusted.
O mighty Caesar!
Do you lie so low?
Do all your conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Boil down to this?
If I’m going be killed, there is no time like Caesar's death-hour, or any instrument Half as worthy as your swords, decorated richly With the most noble blood in this whole world.
Please, if you hate me, kill me now While your purpled hands smeared with fresh blood.
O Antony, don’t beg your death from us!
Although we must appear bloody and cruel now, As you can see by our hands and this recent deed; Still you can only see our hands And this bleeding business they have done.
You don’t see our hearts; they’re full of pity; Pity the general injury of Rome — As fire drives out fire, so pity drives out pity — Has done this deed on Caesar.
For your part, Our swords have leaden points to you, Mark Antony; Our arms in strength of friendship, and our hearts Of brotherly disposition, receive you With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In giving out the new honorable offices.
Only be patient until we have pacified The multitude, who are beside themselves with fear, And then we will tell you the reason Why I, that loved Caesar when I struck him, Have acted this way.
I don’t doubt your wisdom.
Let each man give me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, I will shake with you;— Next, Caius Cassius, I take your hand;— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?
If I had as many eyes as you’ve got wounds, Weeping as fast as they let your blood out, It would suit me better than to close In terms of friendship with your enemies.
Pardon me, Julius!
Mark Antony,— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say all this; Then, in a friend, it is cold shame.
I don’t blame you for praising Caesar so; But what agreement do mean you to have with us?
Will you be counted in the number of our friends, Or shall we go on and not depend on you?
I shook your hands for that reason; but I was really Distracted from the point by looking down on Caesar.
I am friends with you all, and love you all, On this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and how Caesar was dangerous.
Or else this was a savage spectacle.
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.
You shall do it, Mark Antony.
Brutus, a word with you.
I’ll go onto the platform first, And explain our Caesar's death.
Whatever Antony shall speak, I’ll formerly declare That he speaks with our permission And that we are happy that Caesar shall Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies.
It’ll be to our advantage more than doing us harm.
I don’t know what may happen; I don’t like it.
Mark Antony, here, take Caesar's body.
You shall not blame us in your funeral speech, But speak all the good that you can imagine about Caesar; And say you do it by our permission; Or else you won’t have any part at all In his funeral.
And you shall speak After my speech is ended On the same platform where I’m going to be.
I don’t desire any more.
Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
O, forgive me, you bleeding piece of earth, That I’m meek and gentle with these butchers!
You’re the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
I do, Mark Antony.
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome.
Passion, I see, is catching; for my eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in yours, Began to tear.
Is your master coming?
He lies tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome.
Get back to him quickly speed, and tell him what has happened.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, A Rome not safe for Octavius yet; Get going, and tell him so.
Stay here for a bit; You shall not go back until I have carried this corpse Into the market place.
There I shall test, In my speech, how the people takeThe cruel actions of these bloody men; Once I know that, you shall tell Young Octavius the state of things.
Lend me your hand. 
I’ll hear Brutus speak.
I’ll hear Cassius, and compare their reasons, Once they have all been told.
The noble Brutus is on the platform.
Silence!
Please wait until I finish.
Romans, countrymen, and friends!
Listen to my cause, and be silent, so you can hear.
Believe me based on my honor, and have respect for my honor, so you can believe.
Judge me in your wisdom, and wake up your senses, so you can be a better judge.
If there is anyone in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his love.
If then that friend demands why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer,—Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Would you rather Caesar were living, and you all die slaves, than that Caesar were dead, so you all live freemen?
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I killed him.
There are tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.
Who is here so low thatthey would rather be a slave?
If there are any, speak, because I have offended him.
Who here is so rude that they wouldn’t be a Roman?
If there are any, speak, because I have offended him.
Who is here so vile that he will not love his country?
If there are any, speak, because I offended him.
I’ll stop so you can reply.
None, Brutus, none.
Then I have offended none.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
The question of his death is recorded on rolls in the Capitol, his glory not made thin, where he was worthy; nor are his offenses recorded, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, although he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth, just as you all will.
With this, I leave — that, as I killed my best friend for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, to be used when it shall please my country to need my death.
Bring him home with triumph to his house.
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Let him be Caesar.
Caesar's better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus.
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
My countrymen,— Peace!
silence!
Brutus speaks.
Peace, oh!
Good countrymen, let me leave alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Respect Caesar's corpse, and respect his speech About Caesar's glory, which Mark Antony Is allowed to make with our permission.
Please, no man leave, Except I alone, until Antony has spoken.
For Brutus' sake, I’m grateful to you.
What does he say about Brutus?
He says, for Brutus' sake, He finds himself grateful to us all.
It’s best that he doesn’t speak harm about Brutus here.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Yes, that's certain.
We are blessed that Rome is rid of him.
Peace!
Let’s hear what Antony can say.
You gentle Romans,— Peace, oh!
Let’s hear him.
Here, with the permission of Brutus and the rest,— Because Brutus is an honorable man; And they are all, all honorable men,— I come to speak in Caesar's funeral.
Caesar brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms filled the national treasury.
Did this seem ambitious in Caesar?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all saw that, on the feast of the priest Lupercus, I presented a kingly crown to him three times, Which he refused three times.
Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And, sure, he’s an honorable man.
I don’t speak to disprove what Brutus spoke, But I’m here to speak what I know.
You all loved him once,—not without reason.
I think there is a lot of reason in what he’s saying.
If you rightly think about the matter, Caesar has had great wrong done to him.
Hasn’t he, gentlemen?
I’m afraid that a worse man will take his place.
Did you pay attention to his words?
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown; It’s certain he wasn’t ambitious for that reason.
If it’s found to be so, someone will dearly pay for it.
here's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Now watch him; he begins to speak again.
Only yesterday, the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.
Now lies he there, And there is no one too poor to pay him respect.
I won’t do them wrong; I would rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you, Before I’ll wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar,— I found it in his bedroom,—it’s his will.
Let only the common people hear this testament,— Which, pardon me, I don’t mean to read,— And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds, And dip their napkins in his sacred blood; Yes, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention that hair in their wills, Leaving it as a rich legacy To their children.
We'll hear the will.
Read it, Mark Antony.
The will, the will!
We will hear Caesar's will.
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; It isn’t proper that you know how Caesar loved you.
You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones, you are men; And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you crazy.
It’s good that you don’t know that you’re his heirs; Because if you did, O, what would happen!
Read the will!
We'll hear it, Antony; You shall read us the will,—Caesar's will!
Won’t you be patient?
Won’t you wait a minute?
I went beyond what I was going to say to tell you about it.
I’m afraid I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar; I really do fear it.
They were traitors.
The testament!
They were villains, murderers.
The will!
Read the will!
You’ll force me, then, to read the will?
Then make a circle around the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you the man who made the will.
Shall I come down?
And will you give me permission?
You shall have permission.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
Room for Antony!—most noble Antony!
No, don’t press so close to me; stand a bit away.
If you’ve got tears, get ready to shed them now.
You all know this cloak.
I remember The first time Caesar ever put it on; It was on a summer's evening, in his tent, That day he overcame Belgium.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all, Because, when the noble Caesar saw Brutus stab him, Ingratitude, stronger than traitors' arms, Quite defeated him.
Then his mighty heart burst, And, in his cloak covering up his face, Even at the base of Pompey's statue, Which was covered in blood, great Caesar fell.
O, now you weep and I can see that you feel The blow of pity.
These tears are full of grace.
Kind souls, what, do you weep when you only see Our Caesar's clothes wounded?
Look here, Here he is, disfigured, as you can see, by traitors.
O piteous spectacle!
O noble Caesar!
O sad day!
O traitors, villains!
O most bloody sight!
Revenge,—go,—find,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,— don’t let a traitor live!
Wait, countrymen.
Peace there!
Hear the noble Antony.
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
Good friends, sweet friends, don’t let me stir you up To such a sudden flood of rebellion.
They who have done this deed are honorable.
I didn’t come, friends, to steal away your hearts.
But if I were Brutus, And if Brutus were Antony, there would be an Antony to Ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar, that would move The stones of Rome to rise and rebel.
We'll rebel.
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Away, then!
Come, find the conspirators.
But hear me, countrymen; still hear me speak.
Peace, oh!
hear Antony; most noble Antony!
Why, friends, you go ahead to do you don’t know what.
Where has Caesar deserved your loves like this?
Alas, you don’t know; I must tell you then.
You’ve forgotten the will I told you of.
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives Seventy-five dollars each.
O, royal Caesar!
Hear me with patience.
Peace, oh!
Here was a Caesar!
When does another like him come?
We'll burn his body in the holy place, And we’ll set the traitors' houses on fire with the torches.
Pick up the body.
Go, go get fire.
Grab down benches.
Grab down chairs, windows, anything.
Now let it work.—Mischief, you’re working!
Sir, Octavius has already come to Rome.
Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
And I’ll go there straight to visit him.
He comes on a wish.
Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything.
I heard them say Brutus and Cassius Are riding like madmen through the gates of Rome.
It’s likely they had some notice from the people, How I had moved them.
Take me to Octavius. 
I dreamt tonight that I feasted with Caesar, And unlucky things directed my imagination.
I don’t want to go out of doors, Yet something leads me there.
What is your name?
Where are you going?
Where do you live?
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Answer every man directly.
Yes, and briefly.
Yes, and wisely.
Yes, and truly; you had better answer.
What is my name?
Where am I going?
Where do I live?
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
Go on; directly.
Directly, I’m going to Caesar's funeral.
As a friend or an enemy?
As a friend.
That matter is answered directly.
For your house,—briefly.
Briefly, I live by the Capitol.
Your name, sir, truly.
Truly, my name is Cinna.
I’m Cinna the poet; I’m Cinna the poet.
Tear him apart for his bad verses, tear him apart for his bad verses.
I’m not Cinna the conspirator.
Tear him, tear him!
Come; brands, oh!
Some go to Decius' house, and some to Casca's, some to Ligarius'.
away, go! 
These many men then shall die; their names are checked on the list.
I do consent,— Mark him down, Antony.
On the condition that Publius shall not live, Who is your nephew, Mark Antony.
He shall not live; look, I condemn him with a check.
But, Lepidus, go to Caesar's house; Go get the will here, and we shall determine How to cut off some appointments in legacies.
What, shall I find you here?
Here, or at the Capitol.
This is a foolish man without merit, Good to be sent on errands.
Is it fitting that, With the world divided into three parts, he should be One of the three to share it?
You thought so, And took his side when we decided who should die, In our black punishment and condemning to death.
And, although we lay these honors on this man, To ease ourselves of different, disgraceful burdens, He shall only carry them as the donkey carries gold, Groaning and sweating under the load, Either led or driven, as we point the way; And having brought our treasure where we choose, We then unload him and let him loose, Like an unloaded donkey, to shake his ears And graze in the common fields.
You may do what you want to, But I say he's a tried and valiant soldier.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that, I appoint him keeper of the hay.
My horse is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His bodily motions ruled by my whims.
Don’t talk of him Except as a property.
And now, Octavius, Listen to great things.
Let’s do so, because we are on trial, And surrounded by many enemies, And some that have smiles in their hearts, I’m afraid, Are capable of millions of evil deeds. 
Stop, oh!
He’s close by, and Pindarus has come To bring you greetings from his master.
How did he receive you, let me be convinced.
With courtesy and with respect enough, Only not with such familiar instances, Or with such free and friendly conversation, As he used to in the old days.
You’ve described A hot friend cooling off.
Always note, Lucilius, When love begins to sicken and decay, It uses a stiff, cold ritual.
There are no tricks in plain and simple trust, But hollow men, like horses very eager about something, Make gallant show and promises of their spirit, but, when They are supposed to endure a spur that will make them Bleed, they are humbled, and, like false, worthless horses Disappear from the fight.
Is his army coming?
March gently ahead to meet him.
Stand, oh!
Stop, oh!
Pass the word along.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Judge me, you gods!
Do I wrong my enemies?
And, if that’s not true, how should I wrong a brother?
Brutus, this sober face of yours hides wrongs; And when you do them— Cassius, please.
Pindarus, Ask our commanders to lead their men a little Away from this place.
That you’ve wronged me shows in this action: You’ve condemned and punished Lucius Pella For taking bribes from the Sardians here, And my letters, taking his side Because I knew the man, were blown off.
You wronged yourself to write me letters in such a case.
In such a time as this, it isn’t fair That every silly offense should uphold his criticism.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned for being greedy, To sell and advertise your offices To unworthy people for gold.
I’m greedy!
Thank your stars that you’re Brutus that speaks This way, or, by the gods, this speech would be your last.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And, for that reason, punishment hides his head.
Punishment!
Remember March, remember the fifteenth of March?
Didn’t great Julius bleed for justice's sake?
Shall one of us Who killed the most important man in all this world Just to support robbers,— shall we now Contaminate our fingers with lowly bribes And sell the mighty positions of our great honors For so much trash as may be grabbed like this?
I had rather be a dog, and howl the moon, Than be such a Roman.
Brutus, don’t scold me, I won’t put up with it.
Go ahead; you aren’t, Cassius.
I am.
I say you aren’t.
Away, skinny man!
Is it possible?
Listen to me, because I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash anger?
Shall I be afraid when a madman stares at me?
O gods, you gods!
Must I endure all this?
All this?
Yes, more.
Must I give in?
Must I watch you?
Must I stand and bend Under your short-tempered mood?
By the gods, You’ll eat the poison of your proud temper, Even if it splits you, because, from this day on, I'll use you for my entertainment, yes, for my laughter, When you’re spiteful.
Has it come to this?
For my own part, I’ll be glad to learn from more capable men.
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say "better?
If you did, I don’t care.
When Caesar lived, he wouldn’t dare insult me like this.
Peace, peace!
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.
I wouldn’t dare?
No.
What, not dare to tempt him?
For your life, you wouldn’t have dared.
Don’t presume too much about my friendship; I may do something that I’ll be sorry for.
You’ve done what you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, Because I’m armed so strongly in honesty, That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I don’t respect.
I asked you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;— Because I cannot raise any money by dirty means.
Was that rejection done like Cassius?
Should I have answered Caius Cassius if he asked me?
When Marcus Brutus grows so greedy as To engage his friend in such battles, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts, Cut him into pieces!
I didn’t deny you.
You did.
I didn’t.
He was only a fool That brought my answer back.
Brutus has torn my heart.
A friend should tolerate his friend's shortcomings, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
I don’t, until you use them on me.
You’re not my friend.
I don’t like your faults.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
A flatterer's would not, although they do appear As huge as high Olympus.
Come, Antony and young Octavius, come, Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, Because Cassius is weary of the world, Hated by a friend he loves; threatened by his brother; Attacked like a slave; all his faults noted, Set in a note-book, learned and memorized by heart, To throw back into my face.
Strike as you did at Caesar, because I know, When you hated him the worst, you loved him better Than ever you loved Cassius.
Put your dagger away.
Be angry whenever you want to, it’ll have a purpose; Do whatever you want to, dishonor shall be a joke.
O Cassius, you’re connected to a lamb That carries anger as a match makes fire, Who, very irritated, shows a hasty spark, And right away is cold again.
Has Cassius lived To be only mirth and laughter to his Brutus, When sadness and ill-tempered blood aggravates him?
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
Do you confess so much?
Give me your hand.
And my heart too.
Haven’t you got enough love to be patient with me, When that sudden mood which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful?
Yes, Cassius, and, from here on in, When you’re over-aggressive with your Brutus, He'll think your mother scolds, and leave you alone.
Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between them; it’s not proper That they are alone.
You shall not come to them.
Nothing but death shall stop me.
For shame, you generals!
What are you thinking?
Love, and be friends as two such men should be, Because I am older, I'm sure, than you.
Ha, ha!
How this sneering fault-finder rhymes so badly!
Get out, servant; rude fellow, go away!
Be patient with him, Brutus; it’s the way he is.
I'll know his disposition when he knows the right time.
Away, away, be gone!
Lucilius and Titinius, ask the commanders to Prepare to pitch tents for their troops tonight.
And immediately come yourselves and Bring Messala with you to us.
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
I didn’t think you could be so angry.
O Cassius, I’m sick because of many sorrows.
You don’t use your knowledge effectively, If you give into unexpected evil events.
No man handles sorrow better.
Portia is dead.
Ha!
Portia!
She’s dead.
Impatient that I was gone, And upset that young Octavius with Mark Antony Has made themselves so strong;—because that news came With the news of her death;—with all this, she became crazy, And, without her attendants present, swallowed fire.
And died from that?
Even from that.
O you immortal gods!
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill the cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows; I can’t drink too much of Brutus' friendship.
Portia, are you gone?
I have letters that say the same thing.
With what addition?
That Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred Senators By decrees of death and bills in defiance of the law.
Cicero one!
No, Messala.
And nothing in your letters was written about her?
Nothing, Messala.
I think that’s strange.
Why do you ask?
Did you hear anything about her in yours?
No, my lord.
Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.
Why, goodbye, Portia.
We must die, Messala.
I think that, since she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.
Even so great men should endure great losses.
I have as much of this skill as you, But still I couldn’t bear such new like that.
Well, let’s get to our work.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi now?
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
Your reason?
Good reasons must, of course, yield to better reasons.
The people between Philippi and this field Are only our friends because we force them to, Because they are unwilling to give us support.
The enemy, marching along with them, Will increase their numbers with them, and Attack refreshed, reinforced, and encouraged; We shall cut him off from that advantage, If we face him at Philippi, with These people behind us.
Listen to me me, good brother.
Excuse me.
There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, if taken at high tide, leads to good luck; Not taken, all the voyages of their lives Are bound to end in shallows and in miseries.
We are now afloat on such a high tide, And we must take the opportunity when it presents itself, Or lose our one lucky chance.
The deep of night has crept over our talk, And nature must obey necessity; Which we will put off with a little rest.
Is there anything else to say?
No more.
Good night.
We will rise early tomorrow, and be on our way.
O my dear brother!
This was a bad beginning of the night.
Never let such disagreements come between our souls!
Don’t let it, Brutus.
Good night, good brother.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
Where is your harp?
Here in the tent.
What, you speak drowsily.
Poor knave, I don’t blame You; you’ve been wake up too long.
Call Claudius and some Others of my men; I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Varro and Claudius!
Calls my lord?
Please, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep; I might wake you up in a little while About business to my brother Cassius.
Please, we will stand here and wait for your instructions.
I was sure your lordship didn’t give it me.
Be patient with me, good boy, I’m very forgetful.
Can you keep your heavy eyes open awhile, And play a song or two on your harp?
Yes, my lord, if it pleases you.
It does, my boy.
I bother you too much, but you’re willing.
It is my duty, sir.
I shouldn’t make you do your duty past your strength; I know young bloods look for time of rest.
I have already slept, my lord.
You did well, and you shall sleep again; I’ll not keep you long.
If you nod, you’ll break your harp; I'll take it from you, and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; isn’t the page turned down Where I left reading?
Here it is, I think.
How badly this candle burns!
I think it is the weakness of my eyes That sees this monstrous ghost.
Are you some god, some angel, or some devil, That makes my blood cold and my hair to stand on end?
Tell what you are.
Your evil spirit, Brutus.
Why do you come?
To tell you that you shall see me at Philippi.
Well; then I shall see you again?
Yes, at Philippi.
Why, I’ll see you at Philippi, then.
Now I feel better, you have vanished.
Lucius!—Varro!
Claudius!
The strings, my lord, are false.
My lord?
Were you dreaming, Lucius, that you cried out like that?
My lord, I don’t know that I did cry.
Yes, you did.
Did you see anything?
Nothing, my lord.
My lord?
My lord?
Sirs, why did you cry out like that your sleep?
Did we, my lord?
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
Nor I, my lord.
I’ll do that, my lord. 
Now, Antony, our prayers are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down, But keep the hills and upper regions.
Turns out to be untrue; their battles are nearby.
They mean to warn us here at Philippi, Answering us before we demand answers of them.
Nonsense, I’m in their hearts, and I know Why they do it.
They could be content To go to other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking that by this face To impress our minds, they have courage; But it’s not true.
Prepare yourselves, generals.
The enemy comes on in a show full of noble daring; Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something has to be done immediately.
Octavius, lead your battle quietly on, On the left hand of the even field.
I will be on the right hand; you keep to the left.
Why do you cross me in this command?
I don’t cross you, but I will.
They stop and want to talk.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
No, Caesar, we will respond to their attack.
Stay here; the generals want to talk.
Don’t move until the signal.
Words before blows.
Is that the way it is, countrymen?
Not because we love words better, as you do.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, Crying, "Long live!
Not stingless too.
O, yes, and soundless too, Because you’ve stolen their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threaten before you sting.
You showed your teeth like apes, and wagged your tails Like hounds, and bowed like slaves, kissing Caesar's feet; While damned Casca, like a wild dog, struck Caesar From behind on the neck.
Come, come, the reason.
If arguing makes us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Never, until Caesar's thirty-three wounds Are well avenged, or until another Caesar Has added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Caesar, you cannot die by traitors' hands, Unless you bring them with you.
I hope so; I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
O, if you were the noblest of your strain, Young man, you could not die more honorably.
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a man in a mask and a party man!
Old Cassius, be still!
If you dare to fight today, come to the field; If not, come when you’ve got stomachs.
Why, now, blow wind, swell seas, and swim ships!
The storm is coming up, and everything is at stake.
Oh, Lucilius!
Listen, may I have a word with you?
My lord?
Messala, This is my birthday; Cassius was born On this very day.
Give me your hand, Messala.
You be my witness that, against my will, As Pompey was, I am compelled to set All our liberties on one battle.
You know that I strongly held Epicurus, And his opinion.
Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that have been predicted.
Coming from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell On our former ensign, and they perched there, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands; Who were associated with us here in Philippi.
This morning, they have fled away and are gone; And in their places, ravens, crows, and kites Fly over our heads and look down on us As if we were sickly prey.
Their shadows seem like A killing canopy under which Our army lies, ready to surrender.
Don’t believe it.
I only believe part of it, Because my spirit is fresh, and I am resolved To meet all perils very constantly.
Even like that, Lucilius.
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods are friendly today, so that we may, Friends in peace, increase our days to old age!
But, since the affairs of men still seem uncertain, Let's think about the worst that can happen.
If we lose this battle, then this is The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you determined to do then?
Even by the rule of that knowledge By which I blamed Cato for his suicide— I don’t know why, But I think it’s cowardly and vile to take Your own life because of the fear of what might happen— Arming myself with the patience To wait for the help of some high powers That govern us here below.
Then, if we lose this battle, You’re contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?
No, Cassius, no.
For that reason, take our last, eternal goodbye.
Forever, and forever, goodbye, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we’ll smile; If not, why, then this parting was the right thing to do.
Forever and forever goodbye, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed; If not, it’s true this parting was the right thing to do.
Why then, lead on.
O, that a man might know How today's business ends before it comes!
away! 
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills To the legions on the other side.
Let them start the battle immediately because I see Only cold appearances in Octavius' part of the army, And a sudden push will overthrow them.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Let all the soldiers come down. 
O, look, Titinius, look, the enemy flies!
I have turned enemy to my own.
This ensign of mine here was turning back; I killed the coward and took it from him.
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly.
His soldiers were destroyed While we are all surrounded by Antony.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off; Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Fly, for that reason, noble Cassius, fly far off.
This hill is far enough.—Look, look, Titinius; Are those my tents on fire?
They are, my lord.
Titinius, if you love me, Mount my horse and hide your spurs in him, Until he has brought you up to the troops over there And back here again that I may rest assured Whether the troops over there are friend or enemy.
I’ll be here again, even with a thought.
O my lord!
What news?
O, he dismounts too.
Come here, servant.
In Parthia I took you prisoner; And then I made you swear, since I saved your life, That whatever I asked you to do, You should attempt it.
Come now, keep your oath; Now be a freeman, and, search this chest with this good sword, That ran through Caesar's bowels.
Pindarus shall run far from this country, Where no Roman shall ever notice him.
It is only change, Titinius, because Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' armies are by Antony.
These tidings would comfort Cassius very well.
Where did you leave him?
All very upset, With Pindarus his slave, on this hill.
Isn’t that he who lies on the ground?
He doesn’t lie like the living.
O my heart!
Isn’t that he?
Our day is gone; Come clouds, dews, and dangers; our deeds are done!
Lack of trust in my success has done this deed.
Lack of trust in good success has done this deed.
O Mistake, soon conceived, You never come to a happy birth, Only kill the mother that had you!
What, Pindarus!
Where are you, Pindarus?
Find him, Titinius, while I go ahead to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears.
I may say, thrusting it, Because piercing steel and poison darts Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As the news of this sight.
Didn’t I meet your friends?
And didn’t they Put this wreath of victory on my brows, And told me to give it you?
Didn’t you hear their shouts?
Alas, you’ve misunderstood everything!
But, wait, take this garland for your head.
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
Where, where, Messala, does his body lie?
Behold, over there, and Titinius’ mourning it.
Titinius' face is upward.
He’s slain.
O Julius Caesar, you’re mighty yet!
Your spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords Into our own guts.
Brave Titinius!
Look whether he has crowned dead Cassius or not!
Yet, countrymen, O, still hold up your heads!
What bastard doesn’t?
Who will go with me?
And I’m Brutus, Marcus Brutus; Brutus, my country's friend; know me as Brutus!
O young and noble Cato, are you down?
Why, now you die as bravely as Titinius, And may be honored, being Cato's son.
Yield, or you die.
But I yield to die.
There is so much money if you’ll kill me now; Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
We must not.
A noble prisoner!
Room, oh!
Tell Antony, Brutus is taken.
I'll tell the news.
Where is he?
Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough.
When you do find him, or alive or dead, He’ll be found like Brutus, like himself.
This isn’t Brutus, friend, but, I assure you, A prize no less worthy.
Keep this man safe, Give him all kindness; I would rather have Such men as my friends than enemies.
Go on, And see whether Brutus is alive or dead, And bring us word how everything happened To Octavius' tent. 
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
Statilius showed the torchlight, but, my lord, He didn’t come back.
He’s or taken or slain.
Sit down, Clitus.
Slaying is the word; It is a deed that’s in style.
Listen, Clitus.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
Peace then!
I'd rather kill myself.
Listen, Dardanius.
Shall I do such a deed?
O Dardanius!
O Clitus!
What wicked request did Brutus make to you?
To kill him, Clitus.
Look, he meditates.
Now that noble vessel is so full of grief, That it runs over, even from his eyes.
Come here, good Volumnius; listen to a few words.
What do you say, my lord?
I know I’m going to die.
Not so, my lord.
No, I’m sure of it, Volumnius.
Good Volumnius, You know that we two went to school together; Even because that our love of old, please, Hold my sword handle while I run into it.
That's not a job for a friend, my lord.
I shall have glory by this losing day, More than Octavius and Mark Antony Shall get by this evil conquest.
So, goodbye now, because Brutus' tongue Has almost ended his life's story.
Night hangs on my eyes; my bones that have only Labored to attain this hour want to rest.
Fly, my lord, fly!
Away!
You’re a fellow of a good respect; Your life has some smack of honor in it.
Hold my sword, then, and turn away your face, While I run on it.
Will you, Strato?
Give me your hand first.
Goodbye, my lord.
Goodbye, good Strato.
What man is that?
Yes, if Messala will recommend me to you.
Do so, good Messala.
How did my master die, Strato?
I held the sword, and he ran into it.
Octavius, then take him to follow you, Who did the latest service to my master.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators, except him, Did that they did out of jealousy of great Caesar; Only he, in a general-honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.
When should the three of us meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When all the uproar is over, When the battle has been lost and won.
That will be before sunset.
Where should we meet?
Upon the heath.
That’s where we’ll meet with Macbeth.
The old toad is calling me.
In a minute!
Beautiful is disgustingly filthy, and disgustingly filthy is beautiful.
Let’s float through the fog and filthy air. 
What man is that with blood all over him?
From the looks of him, he can tell us the latest news Of the revolt.
This is the sergeant Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought Against my being taken prisoner.
Hail, brave friend!
Tell the king what you know about the battle When you left it.
The outcome was doubtful; Men fought like tired swimmers who cling together And wind up choking.
O valiant cousin!
Worthy gentleman!
Just as when the sun rises and Shipwrecking storms and terrible thunder stop, So from that man, who seemed to bring comfort, Discomfort got worse.
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo, Were not upset by this?
Yes; As sparrows are by eagles, or the hare is by the lion.
Whether they meant to bathe in fresh, bleeding wounds, Or create another Crucifixion scene, I cannot tell.
Your words suit you as your wounds do; They both tell of honor.
Who’s this coming here?
The worthy Baron of Ross.
He looks as though he’s in a great hurry!
He look should look that way with so many strange things To say.
God save the King!
Where have you come from, worthy baron?
From Fife, great king; Where the Norwegian banners insult the sky And, like a fan, make our people cold.
Great happiness!
Then Sweno, Norwegian king, wanted a treaty; We would not agree to the burial of his men Until he paid us, at Saint Colme's island, Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
That Baron of Cawdor shall no longer betray Matters close to our heart.
Order his death immediately, And, with the traitor’s former title, greet Macbeth.
I'll see it is done.
What the traitor has lost, noble Macbeth has won. 
Where have you been, sister?
Killing pigs.
Sister, where were you?
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munched, and munched, and munched.
Give me," said I.
the fat, sloppy woman cries.
I'll give you a wind for your sail.
You are kind.
And I will give you another one.
Though his ship will not be lost, It will be tossed about on the rough ocean.
Look what I have.
Show me, show me.
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth does come.
Quiet!
The charm’s going to bring things to a head.
I have never seen a day that is so disgustingly filthy and beautiful.
How far is it to the town of Forres?
What are these things With shrunken skin and wild clothes, That don’t look not like they live on earth, Only are still on it?
Are you alive?
Or are you any thing That man may question?
You seem to understand me, Since you each are laying a scrawny finger Upon your skinny lips.
You should be women, Only since you have beards, I can’t say That you are women.
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to you, Baron of Glamis!
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to you, Baron of Cawdor!
Good sir, why are you startled, and seem afraid of Things that sound so beautiful?
In the name of truth, Are you fantastic beings or indeed what You look like?
You greet my noble partner With current grace and great predictions Of having nobility and of the hope to be king, that he seems carried away as well.
Only you don’t speak to me.
If you can look into the future, And say what will happen, and what will not, Then speak to me, who doesn’t beg or is afraid of Your favors or your hateful spells.
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
You will be less than Macbeth, and much greater.
Not as happy as Macbeth, only still much happier.
Your sons will be kings, even though you will not be king.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Wait, you incomplete speakers, tell me more.
By inheritance, I know I am Baron of Glamis; Only how am I Baron of Cawdor?
The Baron of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and for me to be king Is beyond belief, No more than to be Baron of Cawdor.
or why You interrupt our journey on this blasted heath With such prophetic greeting?
Speak, I command you.
The earth has bubbles, as boiling water has, And these spirits are like that.
Where did they vanished to?
Into the air; and what seemed solid melted Like breath into the wind.
I wish they had stayed!
Are you sure we’re talking about what we’ve seen here?
Or have we eaten some plant root That makes us hallucinate?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
Yes, in just those words.
Who's here?
Silenced with that story, And reviewing all the events of the day, He found you in the stout Norwegian’s ranks, Not afraid of what you did or the Strange images of death.
The reports came in As thick as hail and every one of them sang Your praises in your great defense of the kingdom, And poured such praises down before the King.
We are sent from our royal master, To give you thanks; Only to bring you, announced, into his sight, Not just pay you for your brave deeds.
And, for as the first installment of a greater honor, He ordered me, from him, to call you Baron of Cawdor.
I was also ordered to add, hail, most worthy baron, For the title of Baron of Cawdor is yours.
What, can the devil speak the truth?
The Baron of Cawdor lives.
Why do you address me By his name?
The man who was the Baron still lives, Only lives that life which he deserves to lose Under the death penalty.
I don’t know whether he combined Forces with those of Norway, or aided the rebel With hidden help and supplies, or that with both He labored to overthrow his country's government, Only his treasons, punishable by death, confessed and proven, have caused his downfall.
Aside.
The greatest hurdle is behind me.
Thanks for your pains.
Don’t you hope your children shall be kings, When those things that gave the Baron of Cawdor to me Promised no less to your children?
That, my best friend, Might still inflame you with passion for the crown, In addition to the title of the Baron of Cawdor.
Aside.
Aside.
This supernatural meeting Can’t be bad, only it can’t be good either.
If it’s bad, Why has it given me promise of success, That began with a truth?
I am Baron of Cawdor.
If it’s good, why do I give in to that suggestion Whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end, And makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs, Against my will to stay calm?
Look, how our partner's in such deep thought.
Aside.
If luck wants me to be king, luck may crown me Without my doing anything at all.
Aside.
Let whatever’s going to happen, happen.
Time and happiness can run through the roughest day.
Worthy Macbeth, we are waiting for you.
Kind gentlemen, every day I turn The page, your pains are registered where I can read them.
Let’s go see the King.
Let’s think about what has happened; and, later, When we’ve had a chance to think, let’s about these things openly each to other.
Very gladly.
Until then, enough.
Come, friends. 
Is the execution of Cawdor carried out?
Haven’t Those in charge of it returned yet?
My King, They haven’t come back yet.
Only I have spoke With someone who saw him die, and he reported That he confessed his treasons very frankly; He begged your highness for pardon; and he seemed Very sorry.
Nothing he did in his life Became him so much like the leaving it; he died As someone one who had studied his own death, To throw away the dearest thing he owned As it were a careless trifle.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me.
You are so far ahead That swiftest way of repaying is slow To overtake you.
I wish you had deserved less, Then the greater proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been my!
I can only say that You are due more than all of us can ever pay.
In doing the service and the loyalty I owe you, I am well paid.
Welcome here.
I have begun to nurture your career, and will labor To make the most of yourself.
Noble Banquo, Who has deserved no less, and must not be known To have done less than Macbeth, let me infold you In my arms and stop you to my heart.
If I grow here in your favor, The harvest is yours.
My generous welcomes, Childishly cruel in being so perfect, seek to hide themselves In tears.
We will go from here to Inverness, And then we will bind us further to you.
My worthy Cawdor!
Aside.
I must fall down on that Step, or jump over it, For it’s in my way.
True, worthy Banquo!
He is so full of courage, And his commendations are food for me, A banquet to me.
Let’s go after the man Whose has gone before us to bid us welcome.
They met me on the day we won the battle, and I have learned by the most perfect report that they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves vanish into thin air.
Only I’m afraid your nature; It is too full of the milk of human kindness To a shortcut to power.
You could be great; You are not without ambition, only without The drive should usually goes with it.
The king comes here tonight.
You’re crazy to say that!
Isn’t your master with him?
One of my friends traveled with him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more breath To deliver his message.
See to his needs; He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse With croaking about the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my castle walls.
Come, you spirits That hear mortal thoughts, take away my womanhood; And fill me, from my head to my toes, full Of most terrible cruelty!
Make my blood thick, Stop up the ways remorse can get into and leave my body, That no feelings of guilt Keep me from what I intend to do, or put guilt between The consequences and the deed!
Come to my woman's breasts, And make my milk poisonous, you murdering ministers, Wherever in your blind shadows You wait on human mischief!
Worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Your letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I now feel The future in the instant.
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.
And when does he leave?
Tomorrow, as he intends.
O, the sun shall never See that tomorrow!
Your face, my baron, is like a book where men May read strange matters.
We’ll have to speak more.
The air Smells light and sweet To our gentle senses.
The temple-haunting martlet, this bird of summer, Approves this place by his loved dwelling places, That heaven's breath smells wooingly here.
I have observed that the air is delicate In areas where they frequently breed and visit.
See, see, our honored hostess!
The love that follows us sometimes is our trouble, Which are still grateful for as love.
Herein I will teach you How you shall bid God to reward us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble.
All our service, If done twice in every point, and then done double, Would be poor and single business to compete With those honors deep and broad that Your majesty heaps upon our house.
For those of old, And the recent titles heaped on them, We remain your hermits.
Where's the Baron of Cawdor?
Only he rides well, And his great love of us, as sharp as his spur, has helped him To get to his home before us.
Beautiful and noble hostess, We are your guests tonight.
Your servants always Have their necessities, themselves, and what they own, in elegance, To make their reckoning of accounts at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own goods.
Give me your hand; Take me to my host.
We love him highly, And shall continue our graces towards him.
With your permission, hostess. 
If this deed were done when it is done, then it would be better If it were done quickly.
This balanced justice Returns the ingredients of the gold cup we poisoned To our own lips.
He has almost finished supper.
Why did you leave the dining hall?
Has he asked for me?
Don’t you know he has?
Was the hope you dressed yourself in Drunk?
Did it go to sleep it off?
And does it wake up now, hung over From what it so freely committed to?
I will calculate your love From this time forward.
Are you afraid To be the same man in reality As the one you wish to be?
Would you have the crown Which you believe to be the ornament of life, And yet live like a coward in your own self-esteem, Letting "I shouldn’t" wait for "I would," Like the poor cat in the proverb?
Pray you, peace!
I dare to do all that may become a man; Who dares to do more is not a man.
What beast was it, then, That made you tell me about this plan?
When you “dared” to do it, then you were a man; And, in order to be more than what you are, you would Be so much more the man.
They have made themselves agree, and that agreement now Doesn’t agree with you.
If we should fail?
We fail!
Only dig deep for your courage, And we'll not fail.
When Duncan is asleep, Which should be soon since he is very tired From his day's hard journey, I will go to his two chamberlains With wine and carousing so Their memory, the guardian of the brain, Will be a wisp of smoke, and the tired brain won’t Be able to think clearly.
Who will bear the guilt For our great slaughter?
Only give birth to male children, For your unconquered spirit should be passed on Only to males.
Won’t it be understood, When we have marked those sleepy two Of his own chamber with blood, and used their very own daggers, That they have done it?
How’s your night going, boy?
The moon goes down at twelve.
I think it’s later than that, sir.
Stop, take my sword.
You take that, too.
A serious calling lies on me like lead, And still I couldn't sleep.
Merciful powers, Hold me back from the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to when we sleep!
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
A friend.
What, sir, not in bed yet?
The king's in bed.
Being unprepared, Our wishes became the servants to what we lacked, Which has worked out very well.
All's well.
Whenever you like.
If you agree with my opinion, when it is time, It’ll be more honor for you.
Good rest in the meantime!
Go tell your mistress that, when my drink is ready, She should ring the bell.
Get to bed.
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle pointed toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch you.
I don’t hold you, and yet I still see you!
Are you, fatal vision, as insensitive To feeling as you are to sight?
Or are you only A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the brain oppressed by heat?
I still see you, in form as evident to my touch As the one I now draw.
You guide me on the way that I was going, And show me the instrument I was to use.
My eyes are made the fools of by the other senses, Or else my eyes are worth all the rest.
I still see you, And I see great, large clots of blood on your blade, Which were not there before.
Sure and firm-set earth, Don’t hear my steps, which ever way they walk, for fear Your very stones disclose my whereabouts, And take the current horror from the time, Which now suits it.
While I threaten, he lives; Words give breath to the heat of deeds that are too cold.
I go, and it’s done; the bell invites me.
Don’t hear it, Duncan, for it is a sorrowful omen of death That summons you to heaven or to hell. 
Listen!
Peace!
It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman, That gives even the worst dispositions a good night.
The doors are open; and the grooms, filled to excess, Defy their duty with snores.
Who's there?
What, hello!
The attempt, and not the deed, Confuses us.
Listen!
If the King hadn’t resembled My father as he slept, I would’ve done it.
My husband!
I have done the deed.
Didn’t you hear a noise?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Didn’t you speak?
When?
Now.
As I came down?
Yes.
Listen!
Who’s in the second chamber?
Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
There are two in the same room.
Only why couldn’t I say, "Amen"?
I really needed blessing, and the "Amen" Stuck in my throat.
I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
Why, worthy baron, You weaken your noble strength to think About things in such a crazy way.
Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hands.
Why did you bring these daggers from the room?
They must lie there.
Go carry them, and smear The sleepy guards with blood.
Weak of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
If he bleeds, I'll smear the faces of the grooms with it, Because it must seem that they are guilty.
Who is that knocking?
What’s wrong with me, that every noise makes me jump?
What kind of hands are these?
Ha, they pluck out my eyes!
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand?
No, my hand will rather Redden the many seas, Making the green one red.
My hands are the same color as yours, only I would be ashamed To have such a white heart.
Let’s go to our bedroom.
Your fortitude Has left you alone.
Listen, more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, in case we are called by chance And it shows us to be watchers.
Don’t be lost So badly in your thoughts.
To know my deed, it’s best not know myself.
I wish you could! 
Here's loud knocking indeed!
If a man were answering the doors of hell, he would grow old turning the key.
Knock, knock, knock.
Who's there, in the name of the Devil?
It must be a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of a large crop.
Knock, knock!
Who's there, in the other devil's name?
Truly, it must be a liar who could swear on both sides of the scale against either side, who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet couldn’t lie to heaven.
O, come in, liar.
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there?
Truly, it must be an English tailor sent here for skimping on the fabric for a pair of a French hose.
Come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.
Knock, knock.
Never quiet!
What are you?
But this place is too cold for hell.
I'll be a devil-porter no further.
I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.
In a minute, in a minute!
I beg you, remember the porter.
Was it so late, friend, before you went to bed, That you overslept?
What three things does drink especially instigate?
By Mary, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
I believe drink gave you the lie last night.
That it did, sir, in the very throat of me; only I paid him back for his lie; and, I think, being too strong for him, though he knocked me off my feet a few times, I still made a joke to throw him off.
Is your master awake yet?
Good morning, noble sir!
Good morning to you both!
Is the king awake yet, worthy baron?
Not yet.
I'll bring you to him.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you, It is still only one.
The labor we delight in cures pain.
This is the door.
I'll make so bold to call, Because it is my limited service.
Does the king leave here today?
The night has been unruly.
It was a rough night.
I can’t remember there being another Like it.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart Cannot comprehend or name you!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Confusion has now made his masterpiece!
Most unholy murder has broken open The Lord's anointed temple, and then stolen The life of the building.
What are you saying?
The life?
Mean you his majesty?
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new monster to turn you to stone.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarms bell.
Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain!
Shake off this soft sleep, death's disguise, And look on death itself!
Go up, go up, and see The great destruction's image!
Malcolm!
Banquo!
Rise up as you would from your graves, and walk like spirits To see this horror!
What's happened, That such a hideous trumpet calls to summon The sleepers of the house?
Speak, speak!
O Banquo, Banquo!
Our royal master's murdered!
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I beg you, contradict yourself, And say it is not so.
What’s wrong?
Your royal father's murdered.
O, by whom?
O, I’m sorry I was so angry That I did kill them.
Why did you it?
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment?
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make his love known?
Help me here, hello!
Look to the lady.
Why do we stop talking, That most may claim we did this?
What should we say her, where our fate, Hidden in a very small carpenter’s hole, may rush up and seize us?
Nor our strong sorrow Ready to be revealed.
And so do I.
So do we all.
What will you do?
Our separate journeys Shall keep us both the safer.
This murderous arrow that's been shot Has not yet hit its target, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore, get to your horse, And let us not be too dainty in saying goodbye, But only sneak away.
There’s protection in the theft That steals itself when there's no mercy left. 
Ah, good father, You see the heavens, troubled with man's acting, Threaten his bloody stage.
It’s unnatural, Even like the deed that's been done.
On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was hawked at and killed by an owl that usually eats mice.
And Duncan's horses, a thing most strange and certain, Beautiful and swift, the darlings of their race, Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flew out, Rebelling against obeying their masters, as if they would make War with mankind.
It is said they ate each other.
They did, to the amazement of my eyes, That saw it.
Here comes the good Macduff.
How is the world going now, sir?
Why, don’t you see it?
Is it known who did this more than bloody deed?
Those guards that Macbeth has slain.
Alas, the day!
What good could they claim?
Also against nature.
Thriftless ambition, that will plunder Your own life's means!
Then it is most likely that The crown will fall upon Macbeth.
He is already named King; and gone to Scone To be invested.
Where is Duncan's body?
Carried to Colme creek, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.
Will you be going to Scone?
No, cousin, I'm going to Fife.
Well, I’ll there.
Well, I hope you see things are done well there, adieu!
Farewell, father.
God's blessings go with you; and with those That would make a good situation out of a bad one and friends of foes! 
If they told the truth, As their speeches shine on you, Macbeth, Why, by the truths made good on you, Might they not be my prophecies as well, And set up my hopes?
But I’ll be quiet; no more.
Here's our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, It would have been a gap in our great feast, And unbecoming to us.
Tonight we host a solemn supper, sir, And I'll request your presence.
Let your highness Command me, to whom my duties Are joined forever with a most unbreakable tie.
Are you going riding you this afternoon?
Yes, my good lord.
We would have desired your good advice, Which still has been both serious and favorable, In this day's council, but we'll do it tomorrow.
Are you riding far?
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time between this meeting and supper.
If my horse doesn’t ride better, I must become a borrower of the night, For a dark hour or two.
Don’t forget to come to our feast.
My lord, I won’t.
We hear our bloody cousins are living In England and in Ireland, not confessing Their cruel murder of their father, only filling their hearers With strange lies.
But more of that tomorrow, When together with that matter, we will have political issues That need us jointly.
Is Fleance going with you?
Yes, my good lord.
It’s time we were going.
I wish your horses are swift and sure of foot, And so go on for your ride.
Farewell.
Until then, God be with you!
Servant, a word with you.
Are those men Waiting for us?
They are, my lord, outside the palace gate.
Bring them before us.
To be king in this way is nothing, Only to be safely king in this way matters.
Our fears of Banquo Stick deep, and there’s a lot to be afraid of in the royalty of his nature.
He has the courage to do a lot, And, in that unconquerable temper of his mind, He has a wisdom that guides his courage To act in safety.
If the prophecy is true, I have defiled my soul for Banquo's sons; I have murdered the gracious Duncan for them, Put doubts and bitter feelings into my mind Only for them, and I have given my soul To the common enemy of man, just To make them kings, the sons of Banquo kings!
Rather than see that happen, come, Fate, into the arena, And fight for me to the death!
Who's there?
Now go to the door, and stay there until we call.
Wasn’t it yesterday we spoke together?
It was, so please your highness.
Well then, now.
You know He was the one, in the times past, who held you back from promotion, and you thought it was our innocent self.
I did so, and I went even further, which is now the point of our second meeting.
Are you so patient that you can let this go?
Are you such believers in the gospel that you would pray for this good man and for his children, the same man whose heavy hand has led you to death, and made your families beggars?
We are men, my liege.
Yes, you certainly could pass for men, In the same way that hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are All the names of dogs.
I am one, my liege, Whom has been so angered by the vile blows and beatings of the world That I am reckless in what I would do to spite the world.
And I am another one, So weary with disasters, so unlucky, That I gamble my life on any chance I can get, Either to make it better or end it.
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.
True, my lord.
And he’s mine too, and to a such bloody degree, That every minute of his being puts A big knot in my stomach; and though I could Sweep him from my sight with barefaced power, And bid my will guarantee it, I can’t do it, Because certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not lose, would only protest his fall Who I myself struck down.
And so it is That I ask see your assistance.
We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.
Though our lives — Your spirits shine through you.
I'll come to you in a minute.
We are resolved, my lord.
I'll call upon you in a minute.
Stay within.
Banquo, your soul's flight, If it finds heaven, must find it tonight. 
Has Banquo gone from court?
Yes, madam, only to return again tonight.
Tell the king that I wish to speak with him, For a few words.
Madam, I will.
Nothing’s ours, all's been spent, Where we got what we wanted, but without content.
It is safer to be what we destroy, Rather than, by destruction, live in uncertain joy.
How are you, my lord!
Why do you keep to yourself, Making the worst imaginings your companions, Thinking those thoughts which should indeed have died With the dead ones you’re thinking about?
Problems with no solutions Should not be thought about.
What’s done is done.
Only let the order of the universe be disrupted, Both the real and spiritual worlds suffer, Before we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That wake us up nightly.
It’s better to be with the dead, Whom we have sent to their peace to gain our peace, Than to lie on a bed, torturing of the mind In a restless frenzy.
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
You must stop this.
O, my mind is full of scorpions, dear wife!
You know that Banquo and his son, Fleance, live.
Only in them, nature's copy is not eternal.
There's comfort in that.
Then, you be happy.
Before the bat has flown His hidden flight, before black Hecate's summons are heard, Before the dung beetle, with his drowsy hums, Rings the bell to end the night, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.
What's to be done?
I don’t want you to know, dearest sweetheart, Until you can applaud the deed.
Come, night that closes the eyes, Cover the tender eye of pitiful day; And, with your bloody and invisible hand, Cancel and tear to pieces that great deed Which keeps me pale!
Things that are bad make strong themselves by ill.
So, I beg you, go with me. 
But who asked you to join us?
Macbeth.
He doesn’t need our mistrust; since he tells us Our duties and the directions for what we have to do.
Then stand with us.
There are still some streaks of day in the west.
Listen!
I hear horses.
Give us a light there, hello!
Then it is he; the rest That are nobles Are already in the court.
He is cooling off his horses.
A light, a light!
It is he.
Let’s do it.
There will be rain tonight.
Let it come down.
O, treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
You’ll get revenge later.
O slave!
Who put out the light?
We have lost best half of our attack.
Well, let's go, and tell Macbeth how much we did. 
To the first And the last, a hearty welcome.
Thank you, your majesty.
We will mingle with these people, And play the humble host.
Our hostess sits in her chair of state, but, when it’s time, We will require her welcome.
Say it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart says they are welcome.
See, they greet you with their hearts' thanks.
There's blood upon your face.
Then it’s Banquo's.
It is better with you out here than he inside the hall.
Is he dead?
If you did it, You are without equal.
Most royal sir, Fleance escaped.
Yes, my good lord.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that has fled Has a nature that in time will breed venom, But he has no fangs now.
Get going.
Tomorrow We'll speak among ourselves, again.
My royal lord, You don’t give the toast.
A good dinner for guests is more like One that’s bought rather than given, if the host doesn’t make frequent toasts.
With no toasts, you might as well stay home, because Away from home, ceremony is the sauce to meat, Getting together would be bare without it.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now, may good digestion follow your appetites, And health on both!
May it please your highness, sit.
His absence, sir, Means he didn’t keep his promise.
Will your highness Please grace us with your royal company?
The table's full.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
Where?
Here, my good lord.
What upsets you, your highness?
Which one of you have done this?
Done what, my good lord?
I beg you, stay seated.
The fit is momentary; in a minute, He will again be well.
Are you a man?
Yes, and a bold one, that has the courage to look on A sight which might shock the devil.
O, these outbursts and jerky shaking, Impostors of true fear, would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Confirmed by her grandmother.
Shame on you!
Why do you make such faces?
When it’s all over, You only look at an empty stool.
I beg you, see there!
Behold!
Look!
Lo!
What do you say?
Why, what do I care?
If you can nod, speak too.
If mortuaries and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our tombs Shall be the stomachs of birds.
For shame, for shame!
This ghost is more strange Than such a murder is.
My worthy lord, Your noble friends are missing you.
I forgot.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me.
Come, love and health to all; Then I'll sit down.
Give me some wine, fill my cup full.
I drink to the general joy of the whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here!
To all, and to him we miss, And all to all.
And get out of my sight!
Let the earth hide you!
Think of this, good peers, Only as a common occurrence.
What man has courage to do, I have courage to do.
Or be alive again, And challenge me to fight you in the desert with your sword.
If I have the habit of shaking, then proclaim that I am The doll of a girl.
Here, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, here!
Why, so; Since you’ve gone, I am a man again.
I beg you, sit still.
You have disrupted the fun, broken up a good party, With very admirable chaos.
Can such things be, that Can overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without puzzling us?
You treat me like a stranger Unlike my usual self, When I wonder now how you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine are blanched with fear.
What sights, my lord?
Only go at once.
Good-night; and better health Attend his majesty!
A kind good-night to all!
Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak.
What time is it?
Almost the middle of the night.
What do you think about Macduff’s refusing to be At our great bidding?
Did you invite him, sir?
I was told so, But I will send.
There's not one of them, except for his house I don’t keep a bribed servant.
I will go tomorrow, (And I will go early in the morning) to the weird sisters.
They shall speak more, for now I am determined to know The worst by the worst means.
For my own good, All other problems will have to wait.
I am now so far Stepped in blood that, if I don’t wade in it any more, It doesn’t matter if I am getting out of it or going over it.
I have strange things in my head that need to be figured out, Which must be done quickly before others look at them closely.
You need to sleep.
Come, we'll get some sleep.
We are still only youngsters in what we’re doing. 
Why, how are you, Hecate?
You look angry.
Don’t I have reason, hags that you are, Impudent and overbold?
How dare you Trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The secret contriver of all harms, Was never called to offer my part, Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done Has been only for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But you can make amends now.
Get going, And, at the sunken place by the river Acheron, Meet me in the morning.
There he Will come to know his destiny.
Provide your vessels and your spells, Your charms, and everything else beside.
And that drop, distilled by magic tricks, Shall raise such unnatural spirits, That, by the strength of their deception, Shall add to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes above wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know, security Is the major enemy of humans.
Listen!
And the right valiant Banquo was out too late, Whom, you may say, if it please you, was killed by Fleance, Because Fleance fled.
Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot think how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father?
Damned fact!
How it grieved Macbeth!
Didn’t he, right away, In pious rage, kill the two delinquents That were the slaves of drink and in the thralls of sleep?
Wasn’t that nobly done?
Yes, and wisely too; Because it would have angered any heart alive, To hear the men deny it.
So I say, He has put up with all things well, and I think That, if he had Duncan's sons in his prison, As, if it please heaven, he shall not, they should find What it meant to kill a father.
Only, peace!
Because from his bold words, and because he didn’t Go to the tyrant's feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace.
Sir, can you tell Where he is?
Malcolm, Duncan’s son, From whom Macbeth withholds his birthright, Lives in the English court and is received By the most pious King Edward with such grace That the evil twist of fate takes nothing From his high respect.
And this report Has so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war.
Did he ask Macduff?
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England, and unfold His message before he comes so that a swift blessing May soon return to our country that suffers Under a cursed hand!
I'll send my prayers with him. 
The cat with the streaked fur has meowed three times.
Three times, and the hedgehog whined once.
Toad, that has spent Thirty one days and nights under cold stone, From whose sweat a sleeping venom was gotten, Boil you first in the charmed pot!
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and caldron, bubble.
Fillet of a snake that lived in a bog, In the caldron boil and bake; Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, A black snake’s forked tongue, and its cousin’s sting, Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble.
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and caldron, bubble.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witch's mummy, a gulf-like stomach, Of the rough sea salt glisten, Root of poison hemlock dug up in the dark, Liver of Christians not baptized, Gall bladder of goat, and slips of pine trees Cut off the tree when the moon eclipsed, Nose of Turk, and Tartar's lips, Finger of a baby born dead Delivered in a ditch by a prostitute, Make the gruel thick and gooey.
Also add a tiger's guts, For the ingredients of our caldron.
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and caldron, bubble.
Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good.
O, well done!
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What are you doing?
A deed without a name.
Though you untie the winds, and let them fight Against the churches, though the roaring waves Confuse sailors and sink ships, Though corn on the cob be torn from its stalks, and trees blown down, Though castles topple on their guards' heads, Though palaces and pyramids bend Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure Of nature's buds tumble all together, Even until destruction makes everything sick, answer The questions I ask you.
Speak.
Demand.
We'll answer.
Say, if you would rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters’?
Pour in the blood of a female pig that has eaten Her nine piglets, and throw it into the flame With fat that has dripped From a murderer's gallows.
Come, high or low; Yourself and duties skillfully show!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff; Beware the Baron of Fife.
Send me away.
Enough.
Whatever you are, for your good warning, thanks; You have helped my fear with your music.
Here’s another, More potent than the first.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
If I had three ears, I'd still hear you.
Why should I be afraid of you?
What is this That rises like the heirs of a king, And wears upon his baby brow the Golden crown of a king?
Listen, but don’t speak to it.
That will never be.
Who can move the forest, bid the tree To walk away from his earth-bound root?
Sweet predictions, good!
Rebellion's head will never rise until the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live until his dying day, the death of His own time and mortal custom.
Do not ask to know any more.
I will be satisfied or shamed.
Deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you!
Show!
Show!
You are too like the spirit of Banquo.
Down!
Your crown burns my eyeballs.
Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this?
A fourth!
Come out of your sockets, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet!
A seventh!
Now I see it is true, Because Banquo, with his hair matted with blood smiles upon me, And points at them for his.
Yes, sir, all this is so.
Only why Stands Macbeth in this way amazedly?
Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up, And show him the best of our delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round; That this great king may kindly say, Our duties did his welcome pay.
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this evil hour Stand forever cursed in the calendar!
Come in, who ever is out there!
What's your grace's will?
Did you see the weird sisters?
No, my lord.
They didn’t come by you?
No indeed, my lord.
Let the air they ride on be infected And let all those that trust them be damned!
I heard The galloping of horse.
Who was it that came by?
It is two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.
Fled to England!
Yes, my good lord.
Time, you anticipate my dread deeds.
The flighty purpose never is understood Unless the deed goes with it.
From this moment The very first wishes of my heart shall be The firs actions of my hand.
No boasting like a fool, This deed I'll do before I change my mind.
Come, bring me to where they are. 
What had he done to make him fly the land?
You must have patience, madam.
When our actions do not make us traitors, Our fears do.
You don’t know Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Wisdom!
To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion, and his titles, in a place That he himself flies from?
My dearest cousin, I beg you, have patience yourself.
Your husband, Is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows What to do in these times.
Things at the worst will cease, or else return To the way they were before.
My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you!
He has a father, and yet he's fatherless.
I am so much a fool, that if I stayed longer, It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I leave you at once.
How will you live?
As birds do, mother.
What, with worms and flies?
With what I get, I mean, as they do.
Poor bird!
You would never fear being caught or dying, The mistakes nor the tricks.
Why should I, mother?
Poor birds do not fall down.
My father is not dead, is all you’re saying.
Yes, he is dead.
How will you do for a father?
No, how will you do for a husband?
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Then you'll buy them to sell again.
You speak with all your wit, and yet, in faith, With wit enough for you.
Was my father a traitor, mother?
Yes, that he was.
What is a traitor?
Why, one that swears and lies.
And are all traitors like that?
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Every one.
Who must hang them?
Why, the honest men.
Then the liars and swearers are fools, because there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them.
Now, God help you, poor monkey!
Only how will you do for a father?
Poor prattler, how you talk!
Bless you, beautiful dame!
You don’t know me, But I know you though in your state of honor.
I know that some danger approaches you nearby.
If you will take a homely man's advice, Don’t be found here, here, with your little ones.
Heaven preserve you!
I cannot stay any longer.
Where should I fly?
I have done no harm.
Only I remember now that I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often praiseworthy, to do good sometime Is a dangerous mistake.
Where is your husband?
I hope, in no place so unsanctified or shamed as Where such as you may find him.
He's a traitor.
You lie, you shag-haired villain!
What, you egg!
Young child of treachery!
He has killed me, mother.
Run away, I beg you! 
Let’s look for some desolate shade and there Cry our hearts out.
Let us rather Stop the mortal sword quickly, and, like good men, Climb over our down-fallen country.
Each new morning, New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face so that it echoes As if it felt Scotland’s pain, and yelled out Like a sigh of sorrow.
What you have spoken may be so perhaps.
This tyrant, whose only name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest.
You have loved him well; He hasn’t touched you yet.
I am young, only something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb To appease an angry god.
I am not treacherous.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an charge by a king.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things disgustingly filthy would look like grace, Yet grace must still look that way.
I have lost my hopes.
Perhaps even there, where I did find my doubts.
Why did you leave wife and child in that rawness, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?
I beg you, Don’t let my jealousies be your dishonors, Only my own safeties.
You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay your foundation solid, Because goodness dare not challenge you!
Wear your wrongs, The title is settled.
Fare you well, lord.
I do not wish to be the villain that you may think, For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp And the rich East to boot.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day, another gash Is added to her wounds.
I also think that There would be hands uplifted in my defense, And here, from gracious England, I have the offer Of goodly thousands.
Only, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, Or wear it on my sword, my poor country Shall still have more vices than it had before, More suffer, and in more ways than ever before, By the man who shall succeed the king.
Who would that be?
It is myself, I mean, in whom I know All the particulars of vice are so grafted That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state Will respect him as a lamb, being compared With my unlimited evils.
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth.
I will grant you he is bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name.
Only there's no bottom, none, In my own evils.
Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire would overcome All international factions That did oppose my will.
Better Macbeth Than such an one like me to reign over Scotland.
Only don’t be afraid To take upon you what is yours.
You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, And yet seem cold, the time you may so deceive.
We have willing dames enough, so there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will dedicate themselves to greatness, Finding greatness so inclined.
With this there grows, In my most ill-composed affection, such A unbendable greed, that, if I were king, I should seize the nobles’ lands, Desire their jewels, and their houses, And my wanting to have more would be as a sauce To make me hunger more, that I should start Unfair quarrels against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth.
This sin of greediness Digs in deeper; grows with a more dangerous root Than summer-seeming lust; and it has been The sword of our slain kings.
Still, don’t be afraid Scotland has harvests enough to satisfy you, Of your very own.
All these are bearable, When weighed against other graces.
But I have none.
I have no knowledge Of the king-becoming graces, such as justice, verity, Temperance, stableness, bounty, perseverance, Mercy, lowliness, devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, But I only abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways.
No, if I had power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Disturb the universal peace, confuse All unity on earth.
O Scotland, Scotland!
If there is any one fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
Fit to govern!
No, not to live!
Your royal father Was a most sainted king, the queen that bore you, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived.
Fare-you-well!
These evils you repeat upon yourself Have banished me from Scotland.
O my heart, Your hope ends here!
Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, has wiped the Black scruples from my soul, and reconciled my thoughts To your good truth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth Has sought to win me into his power By many of these thoughts, and modest wisdom keeps me From over-believing haste.
Only God above Deal between you and me!
for even now I put myself to your direction, and Take back my own detraction of myself; here renounce The taints and blames I laid upon myself, As strangers to my nature.
I am still A virgin; I have never gone back on my word, Scarcely have wanted what was my own, At no time broke a promise, would not betray The devil to his fellow, and delight More in truth than life.
My first lie ever Was these things I said about myself.
What I am, truly, Is your and my poor country's to command, Where, indeed, before you came here, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point, was coming to.
Now we'll fight together, and the chance of goodness Will like our necessary quarrel!
Why are you silent?
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once Are hard to reconcile.
Well, more in a minute.
Is the king coming, I beg you?
I thank you, doctor.
What's the disease he means?
It is called “the evil,” A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often, since my stay in England, I have seen him do.
With this strange virtue, He has a heavenly gift of prophecy, And various blessings hang about his throne, That say he is full of grace.
See, who comes here?
My countryman, but I still don’t know him.
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome here.
Now I know him now.
Good God, soon we’ll remove The thing that makes us strangers!
Sir, amen.
Is the situation in Scotland the same?
Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself!
It cannot Be called our mother, only our grave.
where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile, Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that tear at the air, Are made, not marked, where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy.
No one hardly asks who The dead man's knell is for, and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying before the flowers show signs of sickness.
O, kinsman Too nice, and yet too true!
What's the newest grief?
The news accuses the speaker; Each minute turns up a new one.
How is my wife?
Why, well.
And all my children?
Well too.
The tyrant has not taken action against them?
No; they were well at peace when I did leave them.
Let it be their comfort that We are coming there.
I wish I could answer This comfort with a similar one!
But I have words That would be howled out into the desert air, Where hearing should not catch them.
What concern are they?
The general cause?
Or is it a grief owned Entirely by one person?
Only a mind that's honest Could share some of this woe, although the main part Pertains to you alone.
Don’t let your ears hate what I’m going to say forever, Which will hit them with the heaviest sound That they have ever heard.
Your wife and babies Savagely slaughtered.
To relate the details Would be, on the numbers of these murdered deer, To add to your own death.
Merciful heaven!
What, man!
Give your sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak Builds up softly in the heart, and bids it break.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants, all That could be found.
And I had to be away from home!
My wife killed too?
I have said it.
Be comforted.
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did you say all?
O hell-kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their mother At one fell swoop?
Revenge it like a man.
I shall do so; Only I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot only remember such things that were, That were most precious to me.
Did heaven look on And would not take their side?
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for you!
Nothing that I am, Not for their own sins, only for mine, Cruel slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now!
Let this act be the stone that sharpens your sword.
O, I could cry like a woman with my eyes, And brag with my tongue!
Now you sound like a man.
Come, let’s go to the king; our power is ready; The only thing is missing is our leaving.
Macbeth Is ready to fall, and the powers above Show us the way.
I have watched two nights with you, but I can perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take out paper, fold it, write upon it, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed.
A great disturbance in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do things as if awake.
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
That, sir, which I will not report about her.
You may to me, and it is most proper you should.
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.
Look you, here she comes!
This is her very disguise, and, upon my life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.
Where did she get that light?
Why, it stood by her.
She has light by her continually; it is her command.
You see, her eyes are open.
Yes, only she doesn’t see anything.
What’s she doing now?
Look how she rubs her hands.
She’s accustomed to it, to seem to washing her hands in this way.
I have known her continue in this way for a quarter of an hour.
Still here's a spot.
Listen, she speaks.
I will set down what she says, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
Out, damned spot!
Out, I say!
One; two; why, then it is time to do it.
Hell is murky!
For shame, my lord, for shame!
A soldier, and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
Do you mark that?
The Baron of Fife had a wife; where is she now?
What, will these hands never be clean?
No more of that, my lord, no more of that.
You mar all with this starting.
You have known what you should not.
She has spoken what she should not, I am sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
Here's the smell of the blood still.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, oh, oh!
What a sigh that is!
The heart is sorely perplexed.
I don’t wish to have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
Well, well, well, Pray God it be, sir.
This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on his grave.
Even so?
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.
What’s done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed.
Will she go now to bed?
Directly.
Disgustingly filthy rumors are circulating.
God, God, forgive us all!
Good-night, good doctor. 
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, because their dear causes Would excite a dead man To the flowing of blood and the grim alarm.
We’ll meet them near Birnam wood They are coming that way.
Does any one know if Donalbain be with his brother?
There is Siward's son And many youths without beards which now Affirm they are beginning manhood.
What is the tyrant doing?
He strongly fortifies great Dunsinane.
Now he feels his title Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief.
Who, then, shall blame him when His own vexed senses begin to recoil and attack, When all that is within him revolts against him?
Well, we march on, To give obedience where it is truly owed.
We give out the medicine for the sickly commonwealth, And with him we pour, into our country's purge, Each drop of us.
Or so much as it needs, To revive the flower of royalty and drown the weeds.
We march towards Birnam. 
Don’t bring me any more reports.
I won’t be afraid Until Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane.
What about the boy Malcolm?
Didn’t a woman give birth to him?
The mind I think with and the courage I have Shall never sag with doubt or shake with fear.
The devil damn you black, you cream-faced loon!
Where did you get that cowardly look?
Soldiers, sir.
Go prick your face and hide your fear in a red face, You lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, servant?
Death of your soul!
Those linen cheeks of your Are counselors to fear.
What soldiers, milk-face?
The English force, so please you.
Take your face out of here.
I am sick at heart, When I behold Seyton, I say!- This attack Will give me the throne forever or unseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
My way of life Is fallen into the dry, withered yellow leaf, And the things which should accompany old age, Honor, love, obedience, troops of friends, I think I’ll have, but, instead of them, I’ll have Curses, not loud, only deep, mouth-honor, breath, Which the poor heart would gladly deny, and dare not.
Seyton!
What's your gracious pleasure?
What other news?
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
I'll fight until my flesh is hacked from my bones.
Give me my amour.
It is not needed yet.
I'll put it on.
Give me my amour.
How is your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with a number of illusions, That keep her from resting.
Cure her of that.
That’s where the patient Must minister to himself.
Throw medicine to the dogs, I'll have none of it.
Seyton, send out.
Doctor, the Barons desert me.
Come, sir, get going.
If you could, doctor, analyze The urine of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and former health, I would praise you to the very echo, That should praise again.
You can do it, I say.
What rhubarb, senna, or other purgative drugs, Would do keep these English here healthy?
Have you heard of them?
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and ruin, Until Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That our homes will be safe.
We don’t doubt it.
What wood is this before us?
The wood of Birnam.
It shall be done.
We can only learn that the confident tyrant Still stays in Dunsinane, and will put up with Our settling down before it.
Let a true evaluation of the military situation Wait until we have won the battle.
Speculation only tells about their unsure hopes; Only a certain outcome must settle Which direction the war will take. 
Here let them lie Until famine and the plague eat them up.
If they were not reinforced by those troops that should be ours, We might have met them boldly, beard to beard, And beat them backward where they came from.
What’s that noise?
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
Why was that cry?
The queen, my lord, is dead.
Out, out, brief candle!
Life's only a walking shadow; a bad actor, That struts and worries about his hour onstage, And then is not heard from again.
It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
Gracious my lord, I would report what I say I saw, Only I don’t know how to do it.
Well, just say it, sir.
As I was standing my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and in a minute, I thought, The wood began to move.
Liar, and slave!
Let me suffer your anger if it isn’t so.
Within these three miles, you can see it coming, I say, a moving grove.
I reign in my resolution and begin To doubt the lie of the fiend That lies the same as telling the truth.
Fear not, until Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane;" and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.
Arm, arm, and attack!
If this which he swears does appear, There is no flying from here or wasting time here.
I begin to be weary of the sun, And I wish the order the world were now destroyed.
Ring the alarms bell!
Blow, wind!
come, ruin!
At least we'll die with armor on our back. 
Now that we’re near enough, throw the branch down, And look like the men you are.
Fare you well.
If we only find the tyrant's forces tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Who is he That was not born of woman?
Such a one I am to fear, not anyone else.
What is your name?
You’ll be afraid to hear it.
My name's Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to my ear.
No, nor more fearful.
You lie, abhorred tyrant; with my sword I'll prove the lie you speak.
You were given birth by a woman.
But I smile at swords, laugh scornfully at weapons, Brandished by man that's been given birth by a woman.
The noise is that way.
Tyrant, show your face!
If you are already slain and not by me, My wife and children's ghosts will still haunt me.
Let me find him, fortune!
And I will not beg for more.
This way, my lord; the castle's gently surrounded.
The tyrant's people fight on both sides; The noble barons fight bravely in the war; The day almost professes itself to be yours, And little is to do.
We have met with foes That fight beside us.
Enter the castle, sir. 
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On my own sword?
While I see living creatures, the gashes Look better on them.
Turn, hell-hound, turn!
Of all men else I have avoided you.
You’re wasting your efforts.
Lose hope of your charm; And let the genius whom you still have served Tell you, Macduff was from his mother's womb Delivered by caesarean section.
Curse you for telling me that, Because it has intimidated my better part of man!
And let these deceitful fiends be believed no more, That trick us with double meanings, That keep the word of promise to our ears, And break it to our hopes!
I will not fight with you.
Then surrender, you coward, And live to be the center of attention of the times.
Although Birnam wood did come to Dunsinane, And you against me, being given birth to by a woman, I will still fight to the end.
I throw my warlike shield Before my body.
Macduff is missing and your noble son.
Then he is dead?
Yes, and brought off the field.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, because then It will have no end.
Was he wounded on the front of his body?
Yes, on the front.
Why then, he was God's soldier!
If I had as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death.
And, so his death bell is rung.
Here comes newer comfort.
Behold, here is The usurper's cursed head.
We are free.
I see you surrounded by the finest nobles in the kingdom That speak my greetings by their thoughts, Whose voices I want to hear loudly with mine: Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, King of Scotland!
We shall not waste time Before we make an accounting of your separate loves, And make us even with you.
My barons and relatives, From this point forward you are earls, the first that Scotland ever Named to such an honor.
Really, I don’t know why I’m so sad; It wearies me; you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What it’s made of, where it started, I must find out; And sadness makes me so crazy That I don’t know who I am.
Your mind is tossing on the ocean, Where your ships, with full sails — Like gentlemen and rich citizens on the water, Or as if they were in a procession of the sea— Look over the minor merchants, That bow to them, pay them respect, As they fly by them with their woven wings.
Believe me, sir, if I had such venture out there, The better part of my thoughts would Be with my hope of their safe arrival.
I’d be Still plucking the grass to know where the wind blows, Looking over maps for ports and piers and roads; And every object that would make me afraid of Misfortune to my ships, Would make me sad without a doubt.
My breath, cooling my soup, Would make me ill, when I thought about The damage a mighty wind might do at sea.
I shouldn’t see the time pass in the sands of an hour-glass But I’d be thinking about shallows and sandbars, And seeing my wealthy ship of war run aground, Lowering her high top sails lower than her hull To sink.
Even if I went to church And saw the holy building of stone, I’d be thinking right away about dangerous rocks, Which, touching only my gentle vessel's side, Would scatter all her spices across the water, Spreading my silk cargo across the roaring waters, And, in a word, one minute worth this amount of money, And now worth nothing.
If I had the mind To think about all this, and if I lacked the mind to see That such a thing could happen, wouldn’t it make me sad?
But don’t tell me; I know Antonio Is sad to think about his shipments.
Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it, My cargos are not all loaded on one ship, Or going to one place, and my whole estate is not Based on the fortune of this present year; So, my shipments don’t make me sad.
Not in love either?
Then let’s say you are sad Because you are not happy; and it’s easy to say that Because you laugh and leap and say you are happy, Because you are not sad.
Now, looking at both sides, Nature has made strange fellows in her time: Some that will peep through their eyes forever, And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, And the others of such sour disposition That they'll never smile Although a wise old man swears that the joke is funny.
I’d have stayed until I had made you happy, If worthier friends hadn’t stopped me.
I appreciate your concern.
I see your own business needs you, And you take this opportunity to leave.
Good morning, my good lords.
Good gentlemen, when are we getting together?
Say when.
You’re turning into strangers; has it come to that?
We'll wait until you’re free.
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We’ll leave you; but, at dinnertime, Please remember where we’re meeting.
I won’t forget.
I only think of the world as the world, Gratiano; A stage, where every man must play a part, And my part is a sad one.
OK, we’ll leave you then until dinnertime.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men, Because Gratiano never lets me speak.
Well, keep me company for only two more years, and You’ll never know the sound of your own voice.
Goodbye, I'll be a better talker by dinner.
Thanks, really, because silence is only commendable In a cow’s dried tongue, and in a girl who’s not for sale.
Is that anything to think about now?
Well, tell me now about the lady, The one you swore to make a secret trip to, The one you promised to tell me about today?
You know, Antonio, How much I have wasted my money By putting on a fancier appearance Than my small funds could support; I don’t come to you now to ask that you Forgive my debts, because my chief concern Is to make good on these great debts Which my behavior, sometimes reckless And wasteful, has left me broke.
To you, Antonio, I owe the most, in money and in friendship, And, from your friendship, I have a guarantee To get rid of all my plots and intentions as to How to get clear all the debts I owe.
Please, good Bassanio, tell me; And if it is, honorable, as you yourself still are, Be assured that my purse, my person, My utmost ability can be used for your benefit.
When I was in school, when I had lost one arrow, I shot another one of identical length In an identical way, with more thoughtful care, To find the one I lost, and by risking both, I often Found both.
I owe you a lot, and, like a willful youth, I have lost what I owe you, but if you will please Lend me money in the identical way That you lent me the first money, I don’t doubt, As I’ll be more careful, to find both sums, Or I’ll bring your second loan back again And just owe you thankfully for the first.
You know me well, and waste time here To twist a story about my friendship with examples; And, no doubt, you insult me By questioning the limits of my friendship As if you had wasted everything I have.
You only have say to me what I should do That you think I can do, And I am committed to it; so, ask me.
In Belmont, there is a rich heiress And she is beautiful and, more beautiful than that word, She has wonderful virtues.
The wide world is not ignorant of her worth, Because the four winds blow in famous men who Want to marry her from every coast, and her golden curls Hang on her head like a golden fleece, Which makes Belmont, her home, a rich island in a lake, And many sailors and heroes come to find her.
Oh, my Antonio!
If I only had the means To compete with one of them, I have a mind that predicts such good luck for me That I will undoubtedly be a very lucky one.
You know that all my funds are invested in ships At sea; I don’t have the money or goods To raise such a large sum; So, go out, See what my credit in Venice can do for you, Credit that shall be stretched, even to the outer limits, To supply you for your trip to Belmont to beautiful Portia.
Go now and ask where money can be found, And I will too, and I will not object To borrowing it on my account or in my name. 
Honestly, Nerissa, my little body is weary of this great world.
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were as abundant as your good fortunes are; and yet, for all I see, they that are sick from over-eating are as sick as those that starve with nothing.
It’s not an insignificant happiness, therefore, to be well situated in regard to financial resources: having more than enough comes at some time or other to old men, but having a sufficient income lasts longer.
Good sentences, and well said.
They would be better sentences, if you followed them well.
If knowing what to do were as easy as knowing what was good to do, chapels would have been churches, and poor men's cottages would have been princes' palaces.
It is a good prophet that follows his own instructions; It’s easier for me to teach twenty people what was good to do than to be one of that twenty and follow my own teaching.
The brain may come up with laws to control society, but one hot temper jumps over a cold law; Madness the Youth is just such a jumper, skipping over the nets of Good Advice the Cripple.
But thinking this way is not the way to choose a husband for me.
Your father was always a holy man, and holy men have good ideas when they die; so the lottery that he has thought up in these three chests, made of gold, of silver, and of lead, by means of which whoever chooses the right chest chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by the right man except the one you shall rightly love.
But what warmth is there in your affections towards any of these princes that have already come to try?
Yes, he’s a cunning fellow indeed, because he doesn’t do a thing but talk about his horse; and he makes it a great attribute to his own good qualities that he can shoe him himself; I am very afraid, my lady, his mother had an affair with a blacksmith.
Then there is the Count Palatine.
He doesn’t do a thing but frown, as someone would say, “If you will not have me, choose.” He hears happy tales and doesn’t smile: I’m afraid he will probably be the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of rude sadness in his youth.
I would rather be married to a skull with a bone in his mouth than to either of these princes.
God defend me from these two!
What do you have to say about the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
God made him, and so let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but him!
What do you say then about Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
You know I say nothing to him, because he doesn’t understand me, and I don’t understand him: He doesn’t know Latin, French, or Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I only know a penny’s worth of English.
How oddly he is dressed!
I think he bought his shirt in Italy, his hose in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
What do you think about the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
I think that he has neighborly charity in him, because he borrowed a moneybox from the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his guarantor and it was sealed by another.
How do you like the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
Very disgusting in the morning when he is sober, and most disgusting in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast.
If he offers to choose, and chooses the right chest, you would be refusing to perform your father's will, if you refused to accept him.
So, for fear of the worst, please set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the wrong chest; because if the devil were within the chest and that temptation on top of it, I know he will choose it.
I will do anything, Nerissa, before I’ll be married to a sponge.
You don’t need to be afraid, lady, of having any of these lords; they have told me their intentions, which is indeed to go back to their homes, and to trouble you with no more suits, unless you may be won by some other way than your father's command, that getting you depends on the chests.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla the witch, I’ll die as pure as Diana the goddess of purity, unless I am obtained by the letter of my father's will.
I am glad this batch of would-be husbands are so reasonable; because there isn’t one of them that I am not foolishly in love with his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure.
Don’t you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came here in the company of the Marquis of Montserrat?
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, I think, or so he was called.
True, madam; he, that, of all the men that I have ever seen with my foolish eyes, was the most deserving of a beautiful lady.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of your praise.
How is it now!
What’s the news?
The four strangers are looking for you, madam, to say their goodbyes, and there is a messenger come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince, his master, will be here tonight.
If I could welcome the fifth with as good a heart as I can bid the other four goodbye, I would be happy of his arrival; if he has the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I would rather he heard my confession than marry me.
Come, Nerissa.
Three thousand dollars; right?
Yes, sir, for three months.
For three months; right?
For which, as I told you, Antonio shall be obligated.
Antonio shall be obligated; right?
Will you help me?
Will you make me happy?
Can I know your answer?
Three thousand dollars, for three months, and Antonio obligated.
Your answer to that.
Antonio is a good man.
Have you heard any suggestion to the contrary?
But ships are only boards of wood, sailors only men; there are land-rats and water rats, land-thieves and water-thieves,—I mean pirates,—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.
Three thousand dollars - I think I may take his promise to pay.
Be assured you may.
I’ll be assured that I may; and, that I may be assured, I will think it over.
May I speak with Antonio?
If it pleases you to dine with us.
Yes, to smell pork; to eat in the temple that your prophet, the Nazarene, conjured the devil into.
This is Mr. Antonio.
He looks like a flattering tax collector!
I hate him because he is a Christian; But more, because, in his low simplicity, He lends out money free, and brings down The rate of interest with us here in Venice.
If I can catch him once at a disadvantage, I’ll feed the ancient grudge I bear him until it’s fat.
He hates our sacred nation; and he abuses me, Even there where merchants congregate most of the time, Insulting me, my bargains, and my well-won success, Which he calls interest.
Cursed be my tribe of Israel If I forgive him!
Shylock, do you hear me?
I am debating about my present monies, And, by the nearest guess, I remember that I cannot instantly raise up the whole sum Of three thousand dollars.
What about that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will supply me.
Shylock, although I don’t lend or borrow By taking or by giving excess money, Still, to supply the urgent wants of my friend, I'll break a custom.
Yes, yes, three thousand dollars.
And for three months.
Well then, your promise to pay; and, let me see.
But listen, I thought you said you don’t lend or borrow By charging interest.
I never charge interest.
Did he charge interest?
No, not charge interest; not, as you would say, Directly charge interest; listen to what Jacob did.
When Laban and he agreed That all the lambs which were streaked and multicolored Should be given to Jacob, the ewes, being divided, Were bred with the rams at the end of autumn; And just when the rams and the ewes Were in the act of procreation, The skilful shepherd peeled certain sticks, And, at the moment of mating, He stuck them up before the fat ewes, Who, then conceiving, did in lambing time Gave birth to multicolored lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And good luck is blessing, if men don’t steal it.
This was an enterprise, sir, that Jacob worked for; A thing that was not in his power to bring to pass, But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
Are you telling me this to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast as ewes and rams.
Pay attention, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A good apple rotten at the heart.
Three thousand dollars; it’s a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then let me see the rate.
Well, Shylock, shall we be indebted to you?
Mr. Antonio, many times and often In the Marketplace you have abused me About my monies and my interest rates; I still have taken it with a patient shrug, Because suffering is the badge of all our tribe; You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spat on my Jewish clothes, And all because of using of that which is my own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help; Come on, then; you come to me, and you say “'Shylock, we would have money.” You say so: You that spit on my beard, And kick me as you spurn a strange dog On your doorstep; money is what you ask for.
What should I say to you?
Shouldn’t I say “Has a dog got money?
Why, look, how you get angry!
This was kindness?
Happily, in faith; I'll put my seal to such a promise to pay, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
You shall not put your seal to such a promise to pay For me; I’d rather live in my poverty.
Why, don’t be afraid, man; I won’t default in payment; Within the next two months, that's a month before This promise to pay expires, I expect to get a return Of three times three of the value of this promise to pay.
Oh, father Abraham, what are these Christians, Whose own hard dealings teach them to suspect The thoughts of others.
Please, tell me this; If he should break his promise, what should I gain By taking his forfeit?
A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man, Is not so valuable, or profitable either, As flesh of mutton, beef, or goat.
I say, To buy his good will, I extend this friendship; If he will take it, okay; if not, goodbye; And, for my friendship, please don’t insult me.
Yes, Shylock, I’ll put my seal to this promise to pay.
Then meet me immediately at the notary's; Give him directions for confirming this happy promise to pay, And I’ll go and get the dollars right away, Check on my house, left in the care Of an unlucky rogue, and I’ll be with you Soon.
Hurry, gentle Jew.
This Hebrew will become a Christian: he’s getting kind.
I don’t like fair terms and a villain's mind.
Come on; in this transaction, there can be no fear; My ships come home a month before the due date. 
Don’t dislike me for my complexion, The dark clothing of the polished sun, To whom I am a neighbor, and born near it.
Bring me the fairest creature born in the north, Where the sun’s fire hardly thaws the icicles, And let’s make a cut for your love To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
In terms of choice, I am not only led By the nice direction of a maiden's eyes; Besides, the lottery of my destiny Doesn’t give me the right to choose voluntarily; But, if my father had not restricted me And controlled me by his wit, to give myself As his wife to the one who wins me by that means I told you, you yourself, renowned Prince, would then Stand as fair as any other man I have looked on yet For my affection.
I thank you, even for that: So, please, lead me to the chests so I may Try my luck.
By this sword,— That killed the Shah, a Persian prince, That won three battles with Sultan Solomon,— I would out stare the angriest eyes that look, Outbrave the most daring heart on the earth, Pluck the young, sucking cubs from their mother, Yes, taunt the lion when he roars for prey, To win you, lady.
But, pity the time!
If Hercules and Lichas threw dice to decide Who was the better man, the best throw May be turned by luck to come from the weaker hand: So Alcides was beaten by his boy servant; And I might too, with blind Fortune leading me, Miss that treasure which a more unworthy man may get, And I’ll die from grieving.
You must take your chance, And either don’t attempt to choose at all, Or swear before you choose that, if you choose wrong, You will never to speak to me afterward About marriage; so be advised.
First, forward to the temple: after dinner Your choice shall be made.
To make me blessed or cursed among men! 
Certainly, my conscience will allow me to run from this Jew my master.
The devil is at my elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot” or “good Gobbo” or “good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, get going, run away.” My conscience says, “No; be careful, honest Launcelot, be careful, honest Gobbo” or, as I said before, “honest Launcelot Gobbo, don’t run; scorn running with your heels.” Well, the most courageous devil tells me to pack.
Go!” says the devil; “Away!” says the devil.
Master young man, you, please; which is the way to Master Jew's?
Oh, heavens!
This is my biological father, who, being more than half-blind, nearly stone blind, doesn’t know me: I’ll try to confuse him.
Master young gentleman, please, which is the way to Master Jew's?
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; damn it, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.
Be God's sonties, it will be a hard way to go.
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, who lives with him, lives with him or not?
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
No master, sir, only a poor man's son; his father, although I say it, is an honest, exceedingly poor man, and, thank God, well enough to live.
Well, let his father be what he will be, we’re talking about young Master Launcelot.
Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
But please, therefore, old man, therefore, I beg you, are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
Of Launcelot, if it pleases you, sir.
Damn it, God forbid!
The boy was the very support of my age, my very prop.
Do I look like a club or a beating stick, a staff or a prop?
Don’t you know me, father?
Don’t you know me, father?
Sorry, sir, I am half-blind; I don’t know you.
No, indeed, even if you had your eyes, you might not know me: it is a wise father that knows his own child.
Please, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.
Please, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.
I cannot think you are my son.
I don’t know what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll swear, if you are Launcelot, you are my own flesh and blood.
You have got more hair on your chin than Dobbin my thrill-horse has on his tail.
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward; I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
How do you and your master get along?
I have brought him a present.
How do you get along now?
Well, well; but, as for me, as I have made up my mind to run away, so I’ll not rest until I have run some ground.
My master's a very Jew.
I am starving in his service; you can count my ribs with your fingers.
Here comes the man: give the present to him, father; because I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
You may do so; but let it be quickly so that supper is ready by five of the clock at the latest.
See these letters are delivered, get the servants’ clothes made, and ask Gratiano to come now to my house.
To him, father.
God bless you, sir!
God have mercy, what do you want with me?
Here is my son, sir, a poor boy— Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would, sir,—as my father shall specify— He has a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve— Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify— His master and he, God save you, sir, are almost like cousins— To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, causes me,—as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify to you— I have here a dish of doves that I wish to give you, sir; and what I want is— In very brief, what he asks is impertinent to myself, as you, sir, shall know from this honest old man; and, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
One of you speak for both of you.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he has enough.
You speak well.
Well; if any man in Italy has a better table that offers to swear on a book, I shall have good luck.
And then to escape drowning three times, and to be in fear for my life with the edge of a feather bed; here are simple escapes.
Well, if Fortune is a woman, she's a good woman for this guy.
Father, come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
You have my best efforts to get everything done as you ask.
Where's your master?
Over there, sir, he’s walking.
Mr. Bassanio!— Gratiano!
I have to ask you something.
You’ve got it.
Mr. Bassanio, listen to me: If I don’t put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear only now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, No more, while grace is saying, hood my eyes Like this with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen;” Use all the observances of manners, As one well studied in a sad display in order To please his grandmother, never trust me anymore.
Well, we’ll see your behavior.
No, but tonight is an exception; you shall not judge me By what we do tonight.
No, that would be a pity; I would beg you rather to put on Your boldest face of happiness, because we have friends That offer merriment.
But goodbye; I have some business to see to.
And I must go to Lorenzo and the rest; But we’ll visit you at suppertime. 
I am sorry that you will leave my father like this: Our house is hell, and you, a happy devil, Robbed it of some taste of boredom.
Tears exhibit my voice.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!
If a Christian doesn’t play the rogue and get you, I am much deceived.
But, goodbye!
these foolish drops drown my manly spirit somewhat; goodbye!
Goodbye, good Launcelot.
It’s a pity, what hateful sin it is in me To be ashamed to be my father's child!
If you keep your promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and your loving wife. 
No, we’ll slink away at suppertime, Disguise ourselves at my house, and return All in an hour.
We haven’t made a good preparation.
We haven’t spoken about the torchbearers yet.
It’s nasty, unless they may be skillfully ordered, And I think it’s better not to be undertaken.
If you will please break this up, it will become clear.
I know the hand; in faith, it’s a beautiful hand, And the beautiful hand that wrote it Is whiter than the paper it’s written on.
Love news, in faith.
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?
Damn it, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to come to supper tonight with my new master, the Christian.
I have a torchbearer.
Yes, damn it, I'll be taking care of it right away.
And so will I.
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's house in about an hour.
Okay.
Wasn’t that letter from beautiful Jessica?
I must tell you everything.
She has made a plan of How I shall take her from her father's house; What gold and jewels she has; What boy's suit she has ready.
If the Jew her father ever comes to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter's sake; And never should misfortune dare to cross her foot, Unless she does it under this excuse, That she is daughter to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me, read this over as you go; Beautiful Jessica shall be my torchbearer. 
Quickly, quickly, please, draw the curtain right away; The Prince of Aragon has taken his oath, And comes to make his choice now.
Behold, the chests stand there, noble Prince: If you choose the one that I am contained in, Our marriage vows will be solemnized right away; But if you fail, my lord, you must be gone from here Immediately without any more talking.
I am required by oath to observe three things: First, never to tell anyone Which chest I chose; next, if I fail To choose the right chest, I will never Court a maid to marry for my whole life; Lastly, if I do fail in choosing the right chest, I will leave you immediately and be gone.
Everyone swears to these conditions Who come to take a chance for my worthless self.
What says the golden chest?
Ha!
Let me see: “Who chooses me shall gain what many men desire.” What many men desire!
that “many” may mean The foolish multitudes, that choose by outward appearance, Not learning any more than their loving eyes teach, Which doesn’t go to the inside but, like the marten, Builds on the outside wall in any weather, Even in the force of wind and on the road to ruin.
I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank myself with the barbarous multitudes.
that fortunes, degrees, and offices Were not earned by corruption, and that clear honors Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
Well, to my choice: “Who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves.” I will assume I am deserving.
Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
That’s too long a pause over what you find there.
What's here?
The portrait of a blinking idiot, Presenting me a piece of paper!
I will read it.
This doesn’t look very much like Portia!
Is that my prize?
Is my deserving no better than that?
To insult and judge are different things, And of opposite natures.
What is this here?
Sweetheart, goodbye!
I'll keep my oath, Patiently to deal with my anger.
In this way, the candle has burned the moth.
Oh, these deliberate fools!
When they choose, They have the wisdom to lose by their senses.
Where is my lady?
I’m here; what do you want?
No more, please; I am half afraid You will now say he is related to you, You spend such so many words in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa, because I long to see Quick Cupid's messenger that comes so politely.
Bassanio, lord Love, if it is your will! 
Well, you shall see; your eyes shall be your judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:— What, Jessica!—You won’t eat like a glutton, As you have done with me;—What, Jessica!— And sleep and snore, and tear clothes apart— Why, Jessica, I say!
Why, Jessica!
Who called for you?
I didn’t call for you.
You, sir, always told me I couldn’t do anything without bidding.
Did you call?
What is it?
I am very reluctant to go; There is some ill disturbing my rest, Because I dreamt of moneybags tonight.
Please, sir, go: my young master expects your insult.
So I expect his.
And they have conspired together; I’ll not say you shall see a party, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose started bleeding on last Black Monday at six o'clock in the morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four years in the afternoon.
What!
are there parties?
Listen to me, Jessica: Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum, And the vile squealing of the long-necked pipe, Don’t run up to the windows then, Or thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished masks; But stop my house's ears- I mean my windows; Don’t let the sound of shallow foolishness enter My sober house.
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, huh?
His words were, “Goodbye, mistress,” nothing else.
Goodbye; and, if my fortune is not crossed, I have lost a father, and you a daughter. 
This is the house where Lorenzo Wanted us to wait.
He’s almost late.
And it’s a wonder that he’s late, Because lovers always keep ahead of the clock.
That’s true: who gets up from a feast With the same hunger that he had when he sat down?
Where is the horse that retraces his boring steps again With the same fire That he walked them in the first place?
All things that exist Are sought for with more spirit than the spirit to enjoy them.
How the sailing ship leaves her native port Like a youngster or a spendthrift Hugged and embraced by the prostitute wind!
How she returns like the spendthrift, With weather-beaten sides and ragged sails, Thin, torn, and destitute by the prostitute wind!
Here comes Lorenzo; more about this later.
Sweet friends, I’m sorry I’m late; Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait: When you are ready to do anything to get wives, I'll watch as long for you then.
Who's in there?
Who are you?
Tell me, just to be sure, Even though I'll swear that I know your voice.
Lorenzo, and your love.
Lorenzo, to be sure and my love indeed, Because who do love I so much?
And now, who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
Heaven and your thoughts are witnesses that you are.
Here, catch this chest; it is worth the trouble.
I am glad it’s night so that you can’t see me, Because I am very ashamed of my costume; But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty mischief that they themselves commit, Because, if they could, Cupid himself would blush To see me transformed to a boy like this.
Go down, because you must be carry my torch.
They in themselves, to tell the truth, are as light as a flute.
Why, light is a function of discovering things, love, And I should be hidden.
And you are hidden, sweetheart, Even in the lovely garments of a boy.
But come at once, Because the night is running away, And we are waited for at Bassanio's feast.
I’ll secure the doors, and cover myself With some more dollars, and I’ll be with you right away.
Now, I swear, she is a Gentile and no Jew.
Curse me, but I love her heartily; Because she is wise, if I can judge her, And she is beautiful, if my eyes can really see, And she is true, as she has proved herself; And so, like herself, wise, beautiful, and true, She shall be placed in my faithful soul.
Who's there?
Mr. Antonio!
where are all the rest?
I am glad about it: I don’t want anything more Than to get sailing and be gone tonight. 
One of them contains my picture, prince; If you choose that, then I am yours as well.
Some god direct my judgment!
Let me see; I’ll look over the inscriptions again.
For lead?
Gamble for lead!
This chest threatens; men that gamble everything Do it in hope of a better advantage: A golden mind doesn’t stoop to shows of scum; Then I won’t give or gamble anything for lead.
What does the silver say, with her virgin color?
Who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves!
What if I didn’t go any farther, and chose right here?
One of these three chests contains her heavenly picture.
Is it likely that the lead one holds her picture?
It’s damnation To think such a low thought; it’s too gross Even to be used as her shroud in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think she's enclosed in the walls of this silver one, Being worth ten times less than traditional gold?
Oh, sinful thought!
There never was so rich a gem Set in something worse than gold.
There, take it, prince, and if my picture lies there, Then I am yours.
Oh, hell!
what have we here?
A skull, whose empty eye has A written scroll in it!
I'll read the writing.
Everything that glitters is not gold, Often have you heard that told; Many a man has sold his life Just to look at my outside: Gilded tombs wrap around worms.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio sailing away; Gratiano has gone along with him; And I am sure Lorenzo is not on their ship.
The law!
My dollars and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of dollars, Of double dollars, stolen from me by my daughter!
Find the girl!
You’d better tell Antonio what you heard; still, don’t tell Him without warning because it may be too painful.
A kinder gentleman does not walk on the earth.
He answered 'Don’t hurry back; Don’t be careless with business for my sake, Bassanio, But wait until your plans are realized; And for the Jew's promise to pay which he has from me, Don’t let it enter your mind, thinking about love: Be happy, and use your main thoughts For courtship, and such beautiful shows of love That may agree with you there.” And even there, his eyes being big with tears, Turning his face away, he put his hands behind him, And with affection that was amazingly easy to feel, He shook and shook Bassanio's hand, and they parted like that.
I think Antonio only loves the world for him.
Please, let’s go and find out where he is, And help burn up his tangled depression With some delight or other.
Let’s do it. 
Now, what’s the news in the Marketplace?
Why, the rumors are all saying that Antonio has a ship of rich cargo wrecked on the narrow seas; I think they call the place the Goodwins, a very dangerous, flat, and fatal place, where the dead bodies of many tall ships are buried, as they say, if my gossip reporter is an honest woman of her word.
I wish she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
But it is true,—without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk,—that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—Oh, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!— Come, the whole story.
I wish it might prove the end of his losses.
What’s the news among the merchants?
You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's flight.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was ready to fly; and then it is the nature of them all to leave the nest.
She is damned for it.
That’s true, if the devil may be her judge.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
Damn it, old dead man!
It rebels at this age?
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
To bait fish with: if it feeds nothing else, it will feed my revenge.
If you stick us, don’t we bleed?
If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?
If you poison us, don’t we die?
And if you wrong us, shouldn’t we seek revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we’ll resemble you in that.
If a Jew wrongs a Christian, what is his option?
Revenge.
If a Christian wrongs a Jew, what should his choice be by Christian example?
Why, revenge.
The villainy you teach me I’ll use; and it shall be hard but I’ll make the lesson better.
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and wants to speak with both of you.
We have been up and down looking for him.
Here comes another Jew: we cannot Match them, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
Have you found my daughter?
I often came to places where I heard of her, but I cannot find her.
Why there, there, there, there!
A diamond gone, cost me two thousand dollars in Frankfort!
I wish my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; I wish she were trained at my feet, and the dollars in her coffin!
Why, you—loss on loss!
The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; or only bad luck stirring and sits on my shoulders; no sighs except the ones I’m breathing; no tears except the ones I’m shedding.
Yes, other men have bad luck too.
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa,— What, what, what?
Bad luck, bad luck?
has his largest ship lost, coming from Tripolis.
Is it true, is it true?
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
Where?
in Genoa?
Your daughter spent, as I heard, one night, in Genoa eighty dollars.
Eighty dollars!
Many of Antonio's creditors came with me to Venice, swearing he can only go broke.
I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I am glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring that he accepted from your daughter as payment for a monkey.
Damn her!
You torture me, Tubal: It was my turquoise ring; I got from Leah, my wife, when I was still single; I wouldn’t have traded it for a wilderness of monkeys.
But Antonio is certainly bankrupt.
No, that's true; that's very true.
I’ll have his heart, if he defaults; because, if he were out of business in Venice, I can make whatever deals I want to.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal. 
I could teach you How to choose right, but then I’m breaking my oath; I’ll never do that; you may not win me; And if you don’t, you'll make me wish I had sinned, That I had broken my oath.
Curse your eyes, They have looked me over and divided me: One half of me is yours, the other half is also yours, My own love, I would say; but if my love, then yours, And so everything yours.
Let me choose; Because as I am, I live in torture.
In torture, Bassanio!
Then confess What evil is there mingled with your love.
None but that ugly evil of mistrust, Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love: There may as well be friendship and life Between snow and fire as evil and my love.
Yes, but I’m afraid you speak out of torture, Where men will say anything.
Well then, confess and live.
Confess” and “love” Have been the very sum of my confession: Oh, happy torment, when my torturer Teaches me answers for escape from evil!
But let me go to my fortune and the chests.
He may win; And what is music then?
Then music is Sounds as the trumpets when true subjects bow To a new-crowned king; music is Those sweet sounds at sunrise That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear And summon him to marriage.
Now he goes, With no less confidence, but with much more love, Than young Alcides went to redeem The sacrifice of young women made by howling Troy To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice; The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With tear-stained faces coming out to view The outcome of the event.
Go, Hercules!
Tell me where is fancy bred, In the heart or in the head, How begot, how nourished?
Answer; answer.
Ding, dong, bell.
These chests may not be what they seem outside: The world is still tricked by ornament.
In law, what plea is so tainted and corrupt That, being delivered with a gracious voice, Obscures the evil underneath?
In religion, What damned error is there that some sober face Will bless it, and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with a beautiful ornament?
There is no vice so simple that it takes on Some mark of virtue on outside.
Thus decoration is only the deceived shore To a most dangerous sea; the beautiful scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which skillful times dress in To fool the wisest men.
How all the other passions fly to the air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair, And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!
Oh, love!
What do I find here?
Beautiful Portia's picture!
What minor god Has come so near to making a woman?
Do these eyes move?
Here The painter plays the spider in her hair, and has woven A golden mesh to capture the hearts of men Faster than gnats are caught in cobwebs: but her eyes!— How could he see to do them?
You that choose not by looks, Gamble as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no other new one.
If you are well pleased with this, And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss.” A gentle scroll.
Beautiful lady, excuse me; I come off to the side, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contenders for a prize, That thinks he has done well in people's eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise are his or not; So, three times beautiful lady, I stand I, even like this, As doubtful of whether what I see is true, Until it is confirmed, signed, and ratified by you.
Madam, you have made me speechless, Only my blood in my veins speaks to you, And I am so confused Just as there appears buzzing among a happy crowd After a well given speech By a beloved prince; Where every piece, blended together, Turns to something wild, expressed and not expressed, Except for joy.
But when this ring Parts from this finger, then life parts from my body: Oh!
Then you can be strong and say, “Bassanio's dead.” My lord and lady, now it’s our turn, o cry, “Good joy,” We who have stood by and seen our wishes for you come true, Good joy, my lord and lady!
My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish for yourselves; Because I am sure you can’t wish any from me; And when you two mean to make The bargain of your vows solemn, please, Even then, let me be married too.
With all my heart, if you can get a wife.
I thank you sir, you have gotten me one.
Your fortune stood on the chests there, And so did mine, as it works out; Because courting here until I worked up a sweat, And swearing promises until my mouth was dry With oaths of love, at last, if her promise lasts, I got a promise of this beautiful one here To have her love, provided that you were Lucky enough to get her mistress.
Is this true, Nerissa?
Madam, it is, as long as you are pleased with the rest of it.
And you, Gratiano, are you sincere?
Yes, in faith, my lord.
Our feast shall be very honored by your marriage.
We'll bet them who has the first boy for a thousand dollars.
No; we shall never win a bet at that sport.
But who comes here?
Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend, Salanio!
So do I, my lord; They are entirely welcome.
I thank you, sir.
For my part, my lord, I didn’t intend to see you here; But, meeting with Salanio by the way, He begged me, past all saying no, To come along with him.
I did, my lord, And I have reason for it.
Mr. Antonio Send you his regards.
Before I open his letter, Please tell me how my good friend is doing.
He’s not sick, my lord, unless it’s in his mind; But he’s not well, unless in his mind; his letter there Will show you his state of affairs.
Nerissa, cheer the stranger; say hello to her.
Let me shake your hand, Salanio.
What's the news from Venice?
How is that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be happy at our success: We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
I wish you had won the fleece that he has lost.
There are some harsh contents in that letter That steal the color from Bassanio's cheeks: Some dear friend is dead, or nothing else in the world Could change the constitution so much Of any constant man.
When I told you That I had nothing, I should have told you then That I had less than nothing, because indeed I have indebted myself to a dear friend, Indebted my friend to his notorious enemy, To feed my needs.
Here is a letter, lady, The paper is like the body of my friend, And every word in it, a gaping wound Bleeding heavily.
But is it true, Salanio?
Have all his ventures failed?
What, not one came in?
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?
And not one vessel escaped the dreadful touch Of the rocks that can break a merchant?
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it seems that, even if he had The money right now to pay the Jew, He wouldn’t take it.
When I was with him, I heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he owed him; and I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power, don’t deny him, It will go hard with poor Antonio.
Is it your dear friend that is in trouble like this?
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best conditioned and unwearied spirit In manners, and one in whom The ancient Roman honor appears more Than any man alive in Italy.
How much does he owe the Jew?
For me, three thousand dollars.
What!
Pay him six thousand, and destroy the promise to pay; Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Loses a hair because of Bassanio.
First go with me to church and marry me, And then go away to Venice to your friend; Because you shall never lie by Portia's side With an uneasy soul.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all sunk, my creditors grow cruel, my funds very low, my promise to pay to the Jew is in default; and since, in paying it, it is impossible for me to live, all debts between you and me are canceled if I might only see you at my death.
Since I have your permission to go, I’ll hurry; but, until I come back again, I will not sleep, And rest will not keep us two apart. 
Jailer, look to him.
Don’t tell me about mercy; This is the fool that lent out money for free: Jailer, look to him.
But, listen to me, good Shylock.
Please listen to me speak.
I won’t be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake my head, give in, and sigh, and surrender To Christian intercessors.
Don’t follow; I won’t put up with your speaking; I’ll have my promise to pay.
It is the most difficult to understand dog That ever stayed with men.
Let him alone; I won’t follow him any more with useless prayers.
I am sure the Duke Will never enforce this default.
The Duke cannot deny the course of law, Because of the benefits that strangers have With us in Venice, if it is denied, it will reflect very badly on the justice of the state, Because the trade and profit of the city Is from all nations.
So, go; These griefs and losses have so upset me That I shall hardly have a pound of flesh Tomorrow give to my bloody creditor.
Well, jailer, let’s go on; I pray good Bassanio comes To see me pay his debt, and then I won’t care. 
Madam, although I’m saying it in front of you, You have a noble and a true understanding Of godlike friendship, which appears most strongly In your behaving like this in the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you give this friendship, How true a gentleman you send in relief, How dear a friend of my lord is your husband, I know you show more pride in the work Than accustomed behavior can make you show.
I never did regret doing good, And I won’t now; because in companions That talk and waste the time together, Whose souls bear an equal burden of love, There must be a sharing of things like proportion Of limbs, manners, and spirit, Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the closest friend of my lord, Must be like my lord.
If it’s true, How little is the cost I have paid In purchasing the image of my soul From out of the state of hellish cruelty!
This sounds as if I am praising of myself; So, no more about it; listen to other things.
I don’t want you To deny this imposition, Which my love and some necessity Now lays on you.
Madam, I shall obey you in all fair commands.
With all my heart My staff already know my mind, And will report to you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So goodbye until we shall meet again.
Beautiful thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
I wish your ladyship all my heart's content.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you don’t know about yet; we'll see our husbands Before they think about us.
Shall they see us?
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a costume That they’ll think we are finished With that we don’t have.
Why, shall we turn into men?
But come, I'll tell you all about my whole plan When I am in my coach, which waits for us At the park gate; and so hurry, Because we must travel twenty miles today. 
Yes, honestly; because, look, the sins of the father are to be laid on the children; so, I promise you, I’m afraid you.
I was always honest with you, and so now, I speak my annoyance over the matter; so be cheerful, because I honestly think you are dammed.
There is only one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is only a kind of bastard hope.
And what hope is that, please?
Damn it, you may partly hope that your father had not fathered you, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
That’s a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be laid on me.
Honestly, then I’m afraid you are dammed both by father and mother; when I keep away from the Sea Monster, your father, I fall into an equal evil, your mother; well, you are gone both ways.
I shall be saved by my husband; he has made me a Christian.
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he comes.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.
I shall answer that better to the community than you can explain the swelling of the negro's belly; the Moor is pregnant by you, Launcelot.
It is important that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she is less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
How every fool can play on the word!
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!
Then bid them prepare dinner.
That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
Will you cover, then, sir?
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
Yet more quarrelling with purpose!
Will you show the whole wealth of your wit al at once?
Please understand a plain man in his plain meaning: let your fellows come on, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we’ll come in to dinner.
For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as sense and meaning shall determine.
Oh, dear judgment, how his words are suited!
The fool has planted in his memory An army of good words; and I know Many fools that stand in a better place, Dressed like him, except that a tricky word Defies definition.
How are you, Jessica?
And now, good sweetheart, tell me your opinion, How do you like Lord Bassanio's wife?
So much I can’t express it.
It is very proper The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, Because, having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; And if he doesn’t merit it on earth, It stands to reason he should never enter heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, And place a bet on two earthly women, And Portia is one of them, there must be something else To bet on with the other, because the poor rude world Does not have her equal.
You have such a husband in me As she is for a wife.
No, but ask my opinion too about that.
I’ll ask later; first let’s go in to dinner.
No, let me praise you while I want to.
No, please, let it serve for dinner conversation; Then, no matter what you say, I shall digest it with the other things I’m eating up.
Well, I'll point you in the right direction. 
What, is Antonio here?
Ready, if it pleases your Grace.
I am sorry for you; you are here to answer A rock-like opponent, an inhuman wretch, Incapable of pity, void and empty Of any ounce of mercy.
I have heard Your Grace has taken great pains to modify His stubborn course; but since he stands solid, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach, I confront His fury with my patience, and I am ready To suffer the very tyranny and rage of his With a quiet spirit.
Go, one of you, and call the Jew into the court.
He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
Make room, and let him stand before us.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That you only carry this kind of malice To the very last hour of action; and then, it’s thought, You'll show your mercy and remorse, more strangely Than your strange apparent cruelty is; And where you now exact the penalty,— Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,— You will not only loose the default, But, touched with human gentleness and love, Forgive half of the borrowed amount, Glancing with an eye of pity on his losses, That have been so heaped on his back lately, Enough to press a royal merchant down, And get sympathy for his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of stone, From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never trained To uses of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
You ask me why I would rather choose to have A weight of dead flesh than to receive Three thousand dollars.
What if a rat troubles my house, And I am happy to give ten thousand dollars To have it captured?
What, aren’t you answered yet?
There are some men that don’t love a dead pig; Some that are crazy if they see a cat; And others, when they hear the song of the bagpipe, Cannot hold their urine, because sympathy, Mistress of passion, persuades passion to the mood Of what it likes or hates.
Are you answered?
This is no answer, you unfeeling man, To excuse the flowing of your cruelty.
I am not required to please you with my answer.
Do all men kill the things they don’t love?
Does any man hate the thing he wouldn’t kill?
Every wrong is not a hate at first.
For your three thousand dollars, here are six.
If every dollar in six thousand dollars Were in six parts, and every part a dollar, I would not take them; I want my promise to pay.
How shall you hope for mercy, giving none?
What judgment shall I dread, if I have done no wrong?
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be seasoned with such rich meats?
I may dismiss this court by my power, Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Comes here today.
My lord, There is a messenger waiting outside With letters from the doctor, Just now arrived from Padua.
Cheer up, Antonio!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and everything, Before you shall lose one drop of blood for me.
Did you come from Padua, from Bellario?
Why do you sharpen your knife so earnestly?
To cut the default from that bankrupt there.
You make your knife sharp, not on the sole of your shoe, But on your soul, harsh Jew, but no metal can, No, not the hangman's axe, be sharpened to half the sharpness Of your sharp hate.
Can any prayers get through to you?
No, none that you have sense enough to make.
Oh, damn you, stubborn dog!
And, for your life, let justice be blamed.
Your dog-like spirit That must have been ruled by a wolf Hanged for killing a human, his evil soul Falling quickly even from the gallows, And, while you lay in your unholy mother, Sent itself into you, because your desires Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and hungry.
He waits very nearby, To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
Please don’t let his youth be an impediment to giving him the utmost respect, because I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
Give me your hand; do you come from old Bellario?
I did, my lord.
You are welcome; take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference of opinion That is the present question before the court?
I am thoroughly informed about the case.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Antonio and old Shylock, both come forward.
Is your name Shylock?
Shylock is my name.
Yes, so he says.
Do you confess the promise to pay?
I do.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
On what compulsion must I?
Tell me that.
So, Jew, Though justice is your plea, consider this, That if we all got justice, none of us Would see salvation; we pray for mercy, And that same prayer teaches us all to do The deeds of mercy.
I have spoken this much To soften the justice of your plea, Which if you follow, this strict court of Venice Must give a ruling against the merchant there.
My deeds on my head!
I want the law, The penalty, and penalty of my promise to pay.
Is he unable to repay the money?
Yes; here I brought it for him into the court; Yes, twice the sum; if that is not enough, I’ll swear to pay it ten times over On penalty of the loss of my hands, my head, my heart; If this is not enough, it must seem That evil wins over truth.
And, I beg you, Twist the law once to your authority; To do a great right, do a little wrong, And deprive this cruel devil of his will.
A prophet from the Bible come to judgment!
Yes, a prophet!
Oh, wise young judge, how I honor you!
Please, let me look on the promise to pay.
Here it’s, most reverend doctor; here it is.
Shylock, there's three times your money offered to you.
No, not for Venice.
When it is paid according to the terms.
Most heartily I beg the court To give the judgment.
Why then, it is like this: You must prepare your chest for his knife.
Oh, noble judge!
Oh, excellent young man!
Oh, wise and upright judge, How much more older are you than your looks!
So, bare your chest.
It is true.
Are there scales here to weigh The flesh?
I have them ready.
Have some surgeon nearby, Shylock, on your responsibility, To stop his wounds, so that he won’t bleed to death.
Is it so stated in the promise to pay?
It is not expressly stated; but so what?
It would be good for you to do so much for charity.
I cannot find it; it’s not in the promise to pay.
You, merchant, have you anything to say?
Don’t grieve that I am doing this for you, Because here Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her habit: it is still her habit To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view an age of poverty with hollow eye and wrinkled brow; She cuts me off from the lingering repentance Of such misery.
Commend me to your honorable wife: Tell her the story of Antonio's end; Say how I loved you; speak fairly about me in death; And, when the tale is told, ask her to be the judge of Whether Bassanio didn’t once have a love.
Only be sorry that you shall lose your friend, And he is not sorry that he pays your debt; Because if the Jew only cuts deep enough, I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Antonio, I am married to a wife Who is as dear to me as life itself; But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not worth more to me than your life; I would lose everything, yes, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to save you.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that, If she were here to listen to such an offer.
I have a wife whom, I protest, I love; I wish she were in heaven, so she could Beg some power to change this currish Jew.
It’s well you offer it behind her back; The wish would other make a noisy house.
We are wasting time; Please, enforce sentence.
Most rightful judge!
Come, get ready.
Is that the law?
You yourself shall see the law; Because, as you insist on justice, be assured You shall have justice, more than you desire.
I take this offer then: pay the promise to pay three times, And let the Christian go.
Here is the money.
Oh, Jew!
an upright judge, a learned judge!
So, get ready to cut off the flesh.
Don’t shed any blood; or cut less nor more, Exactly just a pound of flesh: if you take more, Or less, than a just pound, whether it is only so much That makes it light or heavy in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple; no, if the scale turns Only by a hair, You die, and all your goods are seized.
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you at a disadvantage.
Why does the Jew wait?
Take your penalty.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
I have it ready for you; here it is.
He has refused it in the open court; He shall merely have justice, and his promise to pay.
Shall I not have just my principal?
You shall have nothing but the penalty To be so taken at your own risk, Jew.
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll wait no longer.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, That, if it is proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party against whom he schemes Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the public treasury of the state; And the offender's life lies at the mercy Of the Duke only, above all others.
In which predicament, I say, you stand; Because it appears by this obvious proceeding That indirectly, and directly too, You have schemed against the very life Of the defendant; and you have incurred The danger that I just read to you.
So, kneel down, and beg mercy of the Duke.
Beg that you may have permission to hang yourself; And still, your wealth being the penalty to pay the state, You haven’t got the value of a string left; So you must be hanged at the state's expense.
Yes, for the state; not for Antonio.
No, take my life and everything, don’t pardon that: You take my house when you take the prop That holds my house up; you take my life When you take the means by which I live.
What mercy can you give him, Antonio?
A free rope with a nooses; nothing else, for God's sake!
So if it pleases my lord, the Duke, and all the court To set the fine for one half of his goods, I am content, as long as he will let me have The other half to use, to give it, On his death, to the gentleman That lately stole his daughter: Two things more, that, for this favor, He presently becomes a Christian; The other, that he records a gift, Here in the court, of everything he has when he dies To his son, Lorenzo, and his daughter.
He shall do this, or else I take back The pardon that I just pronounced here.
Are you content, Jew?
What do you say?
I am content.
Clerk, draw up a deed of gift.
Please, let me go from here; I am not well; send the deed after me And I’ll sign it.
Go, but do it.
In your christening, you shall have two godfathers; If I had been the judge, you should have had ten more, To bring you to the gallows, not to the baptismal font.
Sir, I beg you to come home with me to dinner.
I am sorry that you cannot stay.
Antonio, thank this gentleman, Because, in my opinion, you owe him a lot.
Most worthy gentleman, my friend and I Have been acquitted today Of grievous penalties by your wisdom; instead of Three thousand dollars, due to the Jew, We will freely pay for your courteous pains.
And stand indebted, over and above, In love and service to you forever.
He is well paid that is well satisfied; And I am satisfied in delivering you, And therefore, I consider myself well paid: My mind never wanted anything else in payment.
Please, recognize me when we meet again: I wish you well, and so I say goodbye.
You push me far, and so I’ll give in.
I’ll have nothing else except this only; And now, I think, I have a mind to have it.
There's more that depends on this ring than its value.
I will give you the most expensive in Venice, And find out where it is by proclamation: Only for this ring, please, excuse me.
I see, sir, you are free in making offers; You taught me to beg first, and now I think You teach me how to answer a beggar.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife; And, when she put it on, she made me vow That I should not sell, or give, or lose it.
That’s the excuse many men use to save their gifts.
And, if your wife is not a madwoman, And knows how much I have deserved this ring, She would not hold out in being your enemy forever For giving it to me.
Well, goodbye!
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring: Let what he deserves, and with my friendship, Be measured against your wife's commandment.
Go, Gratiano, run and catch him; Give him the ring, and bring him, if you can, To Antonio's house.
Find the Jew's house, give him this deed, And let him sign it; we'll leave tonight, And be a day ahead of our husbands coming home.
This deed will be very welcome to Lorenzo.
My Lord Bassanio, listening to more advice, Has sent you this ring here, and asks Your company at dinner.
I can’t do that: I accept his ring most thankfully; And please tell him so; furthermore, Please show my youth to old Shylock's house.
That I will do.
We shall have old swearing That they gave the rings away to men; But we'll confront them, and outswear them too.
Away!
Hurry: you know where I’ll wait for you.
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house? 
The moon shines bright: in such a night as this, When the sweet wind gently kissed the trees, And they made no noise, in such a night, Troilus I think climbed the walls of Troy, And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents, Where Cressida lay that night.
In such a night Thisbe fearfully tripped over the dew, And saw the lion's shadow before the lion itself, And ran away dismayed.
In such a night Dido stood with a willow in her hand On the wild banks of the sea, and sent her love To return to Carthage.
In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That renewed old Aeson.
In such a night Jessica stole away from the wealthy Jew, And ran from Venice with a poor love As far as Belmont.
In such a night Young Lorenzo swore he loved her well, Stealing her soul with many vows of love,— And never a true one.
In such a night Pretty Jessica, like a little witch, Lied about her love, and he forgave her.
I would out-night you, if no one was coming, But, listen, I hear the footsteps of a man.
Who comes so quickly in silence of the night?
A friend.
A friend!
What friend?
Your name, please, friend?
Stephano is my name, and I bring word that My mistress will be here at Belmont Before the break of day; she wanders about By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays For happy marriage hours.
Who comes with her?
No one but a holy hermit and her maid.
Please, is my master returned yet?
Hey, hey!
Whoa, ha, hey!
Hey, hey!
Who calls?
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Where?
where?
Here!
Tell him there's a letter arrived from my master with his horn full of good news; my master will be here before morning.
My friend Stephano, let them know, please, Within the house, that your mistress is at hand, And bring your music outside.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps on this bank!
We will sit here and let the sounds of music Creep into our ears; soft stillness and the night Compliment the touches of sweet harmony.
And wake the goddess of Love with a hymn; Pierce your mistress’ ear with sweetest touches, And bring her home with music.
I am never happy when I hear sweet music.
The man that has no music in him, Or is not moved by harmony of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, plots, and stealing; The movement of his spirit is as dull as night, And his affections are as dark as the place between Earth and hell.
A good deed in a naughty world shines like that.
When the moon was shining, we did not see the candle.
A substitute shines as brightly as a king Until a king is back, and then the substitute’s Condition drains away, as an inland brook does Into the river of waters.
Music!
Listen!
It is your music, madam, from the house.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect: I think it sounds much sweeter at night than by day.
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
The crow sings as sweetly as the lark When either is waited on, and I think The nightingale, if she sang by day, When every goose is cackling, would be considered No better a musician than the wren.
The moon sleeps with her lover, And does not want to be awakened!
That is the voice, Or I am much mistaken, of Portia.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By my bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which are moving along quickly, we hope, the better For our words.
Have they returned?
Madam, not yet; But there is come a messenger ahead of them, To show that they are coming.
Go in, Nerissa: Give orders to my servants that they take No notice at all of our being absent from here; Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
We should hold day with the direct opposite, If you would walk in absence of the sun.
I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend: This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely indebted.
No more than I am well released from.
A quarrel, hey, already!
What's the matter?
You swore to me, when I gave it you, That you would wear it until the hour of your death, And that it would go with you to your grave; You should have respected and have kept it Though not for me, but for your intense oaths.
Gave it a judge's clerk!
No, God's my judge, The clerk will never grow a beard that took it.
He will, if he lives to be a man.
Yes, if a woman lives to be a man.
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy No taller than you, the judge's clerk; A chattering boy that asked for it as a fee; I could not, for my heart, deny him the ring.
You are to blame,—I must be plain with you,— To part so quickly with your wife's first gift, A thing stuck on your finger with oaths, And so nailed with faith to your flesh with faith.
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it, and here he stands, I would dare to swear for him that he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for all the wealth In the world.
Now, truly, Gratiano, You give your wife a cause for grief that is very unkind; If it was given to me, I should be angry about it.
Why, it would be better if I cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away To the judge that asked for it, and indeed Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he asked for mine; And neither man nor master would take anything else But the two rings.
What ring did you give, my lord?
Not the one, I hope, that you got from me.
If I could add a lie to a fault, I would deny it; but you see my finger Hasn’t got the ring on it; it is gone.
And neither will I Until I see mine again.
Sweet Portia, If you knew to whom I gave the ring, If you knew for whom I gave the ring, And would think about for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I let the ring go, When nothing would be accepted but the ring, You would decrease the strength of your anger.
If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half the worthiness of her who gave the ring, Or your own honor to hold the ring, You wouldn’t have parted then with the ring.
What man is there so very unreasonable, That, if you had bothered to defend it With any terms of earnestness, lacked the modesty To encourage the thing be held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I'll die for it, but some woman took the ring.
No, by my honor, madam, by my soul, No woman took it, but a civil doctor, Which refused three thousand dollars of me, And begged for the ring, which I denied him, And let him go away displeased, Even he that had delayed the very life Of my dear friend.
What should I say, sweet lady?
I forced to send the ring after him; I was overcome with shame and courtesy; My honor would not let ingratitude So much offend it.
Pardon me, good lady; Because, by these blessed candles of the night, If you had been there, I think you would have begged The ring from me to give the worthy doctor.
And I his clerk; so be well advised How you leave me to my own protection.
Well, do so: don’t let me take him then; Because, if I do, I'll break the young clerk's pen.
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Sir, don’t grieve; you are welcome nevertheless.
Portia, forgive me this forced wrong; And in the hearing of these many friends, I swear to you, even by your own beautiful eyes, That I see myself in,— Listen, only that!
In both my eyes, he doubly sees himself, One in each eye; swear by your double self, And there's an oath to believe.
No, but listen to me: Pardon this fault, and, by my soul, I swear I will never again break an oath made to you.
Then you shall be his insurance.
Give him this, And tell him keep it better than the other one.
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
I got it from him: pardon me, Bassanio, Because, by this ring, the doctor slept with me.
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, Because that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, Instead of this, slept with me last night.
Are we betrayed before we have deserved it?
I am speechless.
You were the doctor, and I didn’t know you?
You were you the clerk that is to betray me?
Yes, but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he lives until he is a man.
Sweet doctor, you shall be my lover: When I am absent, then you can lie with my wife.
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living, Because here I read for certain that my ships Have safely come home.
How is it now, Lorenzo!
My clerk has some good comforts for you, too.
Beautiful ladies, you drop holy bread in the way Of starved people.
It is almost morning, And I am still sure you are not totally satisfied About these events full.
Let’s go in; And ask us all your questions, And we’ll answer everything truthfully.
Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing So much as keeping Nerissa's ring safe. 
Now, fair Hippolyta, the time for our wedding is very close; Just four more happy days until the new moon.
Four days will quickly dissolve into four nights; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like a silver slice in the heavens, Will light the night of our wedding solemnities.
Go, Philostrate, Stir up the young people of Athens to start swinging; Get the party spirit going; Turn sadness back to the funerals — No sadness at our parties.
Hippolyta, I got you by waging war with you, And made you love me by doing you injuries; But I will marry you in a different way, With pomp, with triumph, and with partying!
Regards to Theseus, our renowned duke!
Since she belongs to me, I may dispose of her, Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Which is fit to these circumstances.
What do you say, Hermia?
Be careful, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god, A god that created your beauty, yes, and a god Who sees you as a piece of wax that he has imprinted, And it is within his power to leave the wax as it is, Or to disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
So is Lysander.
In any other case, he is.
I wish my father could see with my eyes.
No, you must see with your father’s eyes.
I beg your grace to pardon me.
Either to die or to swear to avoid The society of men forever.
Therefore, fair Hermia, think about what you’re doing, Think about how young you are, examine your choices well, Whether, if you don’t take your father's choice, You can endure life in a convent, To be shut up in a cloister, To live a childless nun all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.
Those who can discipline themselves to undertake Such a heavenly path for piety are blessed three times; But those who are in a convent to avoid marriage Grow, live, and die, in single blessedness.
Well, that’s how I will grow, live, and die, my lord, Before I will give up my virginity To his lordship.
Take time to think about it; and, by the next new moon,— The wedding day of my love and me, For the everlasting bond of fellowship,— On that day either prepare to die Because you have disobeyed your father's will; Or else marry Demetrius, as your father wants you to; Or accept the austerity and single life of a nun.
Give in, sweet Hermia;—and, Lysander, give up Your crazy claim to my future bride.
Scornful Lysander!
Yes, Demetrius has my approval; And everything I own I will leave to him; And she is mine; and all my rights concerning her, I leave to Demetrius.
I am, my lord, as well born as he is, As rich; my love is better than his; My fortunes, no matter which way you look at it, Are as good as Demetrius'; And, furthermore, which is more important than all these qualities, Hermia loves me too!
Why shouldn’t I pursue Hermia?
Demetrius, I'll swear it on his head, Pursued Nedar's daughter, Helena, the same way, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, loves, Devoutly loves, loves to the point of divine worship, This spotted and inconstant man.
are you okay, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go ahead; I must ask you to do a few things about the wedding, And meet with you about some issues that affect you.
We follow you, because we should and because we want to.
What’s the matter, my love!
Why do you look so pale?
Why do the roses in your cheeks fade so fast?
Oh dear!
I am too good to be in love with someone so low!
Or else mismatched in terms of years;— Oh spite!
I am too old to be engaged to someone so young!
to choose love by what another person sees!
A good argument; therefore, listen to me, Hermia.
There, gentle Hermia, I may marry you; And the sharp Athenian law cannot follow us To that place.
If you love me then, Sneaker away from your father's house tomorrow night; And, in the forest, three miles outside town, Where I met you once, with Helena, To celebrate a May Day morning party, I will wait for you there.
My good Lysander!
I swear to you by Cupid's strongest bow, By his best arrow, the one with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knits souls and favors lovers, And by that fire which burned Dido, the Carthage queen, When the false Trojan, Aeneas, was seen sailing away,— By all the vows that men have forever broken, In greater numbers than women have ever spoken,— In that same place you have described to me, I will meet you tomorrow, truly.
Keep that promise, love.
Look, here comes Helena.
Hi, fair Helena!
Where are you going?
If the world were mine, and Demetrius mine, I would give everything else to you to be changed anyway you want.
Oh, teach me your look, and with what magic You have stolen Demetrius' heart!
I frown at him, but he still loves me.
Oh I wish your frowns would teach my smiles to have that effect!
I give him curses, but he gives me love.
Oh that my prayers could be answered with such affection!
The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.
The more I love him, the more he hates me.
His silly behavior, Helena, is not my fault.
Take it easy; he shall see my face no more; Lysander and I are going to leave this place quickly.
Before I started seeing Lysander, Athens seemed like a paradise to me.
Oh, so what graces, then, does he have, That he has turned a heaven into hell!
we must not give in To hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow.
I will, my Hermia.
How happy can some other “other” be!
I am considered as fair as she is throughout Athens.
But so what?
Demetrius doesn’t think so; He won’t know what everyone but him knows.
Love can transpose things that are low and ugly, Having no good qualities at all, Into things that have beauty and dignity.
Love doesn’t look with the eyes, but with the mind; And that’s why Cupid is painted with a blindfold.
Because, before Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyes, He swore many oaths that he was only mine; And, when this torrent of oaths was rejected by Hermia, Demetrius dissolved, and his oaths melted too.
I’ll tell him of fair Hermia's flight; Then tomorrow night, he will pursue her To the forest, and, even if he just thanks me For this knowledge, it is sweet payment.
But I mean to make my pain worth suffering, To have him look at me there and back again. 
Is everybody here?
It would be better if you took attendance, man by man, according to the list.
Here is the list of every man's name, who are thought to be the best in all Athens, to play in our play before the duke and duchess at night on their wedding-day.
First, good Peter Quince, tell us what the play’s about, then read the names of the actors; and so get to the point.
By Mary, our play is—The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.
Ok, guys, spread out.
I’m ready.
Tell me what my part is, and then proceed.
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
What is Pyramus?
a lover, or a tyrant?
A lover that kills himself most gallantly for love.
That will require some tears in the true performance of it.
I will move them to storms of tears; I will rouse their pity in some measure.
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
Here, Peter Quince.
Flute, you must take the role of Thisbe.
What is Thisbe?
A wandering knight?
It is the lady that Pyramus loves.
No, please, don’t let me play a woman; I have a beard starting t o grow.
That’s nothing to worry about; You shall play it with a mask on, and you can make your voice as light as you want.
If I can hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
Ok. Go ahead.
Robin Starveling, the tailor.
Here, Peter Quince.
Here, Peter Quince.
Have you written the lion's part?
Please, if it is, give it to me now, because I am slow in studying my lines.
You may do it off the top of your head, because it’s nothing but roaring.
Let me play the lion too.
I will roar so well that it will do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar so well that I will make the duke say, “Let him roar again, let him roar again.” If you should do it too terribly, you would so frighten the duchess and the ladies, that they would scream; and that would be enough to hang us all.
That would hang us, every mother's son.
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man that you shall see on a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must absolutely play Pyramus.
OK, I’ll do it.
What beard would be best to play it in?
Whichever one you want.
I will play it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play it with no beard!
In the meantime, I will draw a list of props, that our play needs.
I beg you, don’t let me down.
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
Be careful; be perfect; goodbye.
We’ll meet at the duke's oak.
Enough; stay or get going! 
Hey, spirit!
Where are you going?
Over hill, over dale, Through bush, through brier, Over park, over pale, Through flood, through fire, I am going everywhere, Quicker than the moon goes through the sky; And I serve the fairy queen, To put dewdrops into her eyes upon the green.
Farewell, you group of spirits; I have to get going.
Our queen and all her elves are coming here any minute!
Oberon is really angry and annoyed, Because she, just like her attendant, has A lovely boy, that was stolen from an Indian king; She has never had so sweet a baby that was stolen.
And now Titania and Oberon can never meet in the grove or on green, By a clear fountain, or spangled shiny starlight, But they refuse to settle the issue, so that all their elves Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there, because they’re so frightened.
aren’t you the guy That scares the maidens of the village; Skims cream from milk, and sometimes works the churn, And, bootless, makes the breathless housewife churn even harder; And sometimes makes the drink so that it doesn’t have a yeasty foam; Misleads wanderers who are out at night, laughing at their getting lost?
Those that call you Hobgoblin, and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I am jester to Oberon and make him smile, as When I trick a fat horse that’s been eating beans into Neighing like a newborn female; And sometimes, I hide near to the town gossip's beer mug, Looking like a roasted crab; And, when the gossip drinks, I bob up, against her lips, And pour the ale on the withered skin of her neck skin all the way down.
How unfortunate to meet you by moonlight, proud Titania.
Well, well, jealous Oberon!
Fairies, let’s go; I have sworn not to go to his bed or to keep his company.
am not I your lord?
Then I must be your lady; but I also know that, When you have stolen away from fairy-land, And, taking the shape of Corin, the shepherd, You have sat all day, playing on pipes of corn, And speaking love poems to amorous Phillida.
How can you say these things, for shame, Titania, Give me a little more credit than that with Hippolyta, Knowing I know all about your love for Theseus?
Didn’t you lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia, the girl he had just raped?
And make him break his promise with fair Aegle, Not to mention with Ariadne and Antiopa?
These fogs which, falling in the land, Have made every rough river so high That they have flooded the continents where they flow.
The human mortals want their winter here; Blessed hymns and carols are sung every night— The moon that controls the flow of the floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, But there are still many bad diseases.
ice-cold frosts Freeze the fresh crimson roses; And on the old God of Harmony’s chin and icy crown, Is set a circle of sweet summer buds Almost in mockery of the frost.
The spring, the summer, The pregnant autumn, and angry winter change Their usual clothes; and the amazed world, Now doesn’t know which is which by their apparel.
Then fix it.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
But she, because she was mortal, died giving birth to the boy; And, for her sake, I am raising him, And, for her sake, I will not part with him.
How long do you intend to stay within this forest?
Maybe until after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently join our dances, And see our moonlight parties, go with us; If not, leave me alone, and I won’t comment on where you’re going.
Give me that boy and I will go with you.
Not for your entire fairy kingdom.
Fairies, let’s go.
This will only lead to another argument if I stay longer.
My gentle Puck, come here.
You remember That time I sat on a big rock by the ocean, And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back, Singing such a sweet and melodious song That the rough sea became calm when it heard it, And certain stars shot madly out of their orbits To hear the sea-maid's music?
I remember.
But I watched and noted where Cupid’s arrow fell.
Putting the juice of it on sleeping eyelids Will make or man or woman madly fall in love With the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb and come right back Before a huge sea creature can swim three miles.
I'll make my trip around the world In forty minutes.
And before I remove this charm from her sight — Because I have another herb that is the antidote — I'll make her give that boy to me.
But who’s coming here?
I’ll make myself invisible, And I eavesdrop on their conversation.
I don’t love you, so stop following me.
Where are Lysander and fair Hermia?
I’ll kill him, and she kills me.
You told me they snuck into this forest, And I’m here and wander within this forest, Because I cannot meet Hermia.
Listen, get going and, once and for all, stop following me!
Even if you didn’t have the power to pull me, I would still be powerless not to follow you.
Do I encourage you?
Do I talk to you sweetly?
Or, rather, do I not, in plainest truth, Tell you I do not and cannot love you?
And even for that, I love you all the more.
I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius, The more you beat me, the more I will wag my tail for you.
What worse place can I beg in your love, And still keep my self-respect — Than to be used as you would use your dog?
Don’t try my patience and push me too hard, Because the sight of you makes me sick.
And I am sick when I don’t look at you.
You are really putting your virginity at risk, To leave the city, and surrender yourself To the hands of someone who doesn’t love you, To go night thinking that nothing can happen, And to come to a deserted place, With something as rich as your virginity.
I trust your virtue as a man.
It isn’t night whenever I see your face, So I don’t think it’s night, And this forest doesn’t lack worlds of company, For you, in my respect, are all the world.
Then how can it be said I am alone When the entire world is here to look at me?
I'll run from you, and hide in the bushes, And leave you to the mercy of wild beasts.
Apollo flies, and Daphne chases him; The dove pursues the vulture; the mild deer Runs faster to catch the tiger — helpless speed, When cowardice chases and courage flies.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do something to me.
Shame on you, Demetrius!
I'll follow you, and make a heaven of hell, To die by the hand that I love so well.
Welcome, wanderer.
Yes, there it is.
Please give it to me.
You’ll be able to identify the man By the Athenian garments he has on.
Please do this carefully, that he will be more in love with her than she is with him.
And meet me before the first rooster crows at dawn.
You have nothing to be afraid of, my lord; I’ll do it. 
Come, now a dance and a fairy song, Then, for the third part of a minute, leave here, Some to kill bugs in the musk-rose buds, Some to kill red-mice for their leather wings, To make my small elves coats; and some to quiet The noisy owl, that nightly hoots and wonders About us.
Sing me now to sleep, Then go to your tasks, and let me rest.
You spotted snakes, with double tongue, Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen; Newts and blindworms do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen.
Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby.
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
Let’s go; now all is well.
One of you, stand sentinel over there.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Fair love, you are exhausted with wandering in the forest.
You find yourself a bed, And I will rest my head upon this bank.
One bit of land will be a pillow for us both; One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one trust.
Oh, sweetheart, take what I said in an innocent sense.
Love takes the meaning in love's conversation.
Then don’t tell me not to sleep by your side, Because in sleeping near you, Hermia, I do not lie.
Lysander riddles very prettily.
Now curse my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
May your love never change until your sweet life ends!
Amen, amen, I say to that fair prayer, And then my life end when I end loyalty!
I’ve gone through the whole forest, But I haven’t found any Athenian On whose eyes I might pour This flower's juice to stir his love.
Pretty soul!
she doesn’t dare lie Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
So awake when I am gone; For I must go now to Oberon.
Stay, though you kill me, sweet Demetrius.
I order you, get far away from me and do not haunt me thus.
Oh, will you, a dark-natured man, leave me?
Don’t.
Stay here at your own risk; I will go on alone.
Oh, I am out of breath in this happy chase!
The more I pray, the less grace I have.
Hermia is happy, wherever she lies, Because she has blessed and attractive eyes.
How did her eyes come to be so bright?
What wicked and lying mirror of mine Made me compare my eyes with Hermia's?
But who’s here?—Lysander!
on the ground!
I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, wake up!
And I will run through fire, I will, for your sweet sake.
Transparent Helena!
Nature has made it so that I can see through your chest all the way to your heart.
Where is Demetrius?
Oh, how fitting it is that That vile name should perish on my sword!
Don’t say that, Lysander, don’t say that.
So what if he loves your Hermia?
Lord, so what?
Content with Hermia?
The will of man is persuaded by his reason, And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things that grow are not ripe until it’s their season to be ripe, So I, being young, have not been ripened in reason, And touching the point of human skill now, Reason has become the commander of my will, And it leads me to your eyes, where I see Love's stories, written in love's richest book.
Why was I born to this keen mockery?
When did I earn this scorn at your hands?
Isn’t it enough, isn’t it enough, young man, That I never did, no, nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must joke about what I’m lacking?
Good lord, you do me wrong— good lord, you do— To court me In such disdainful manner.
Oh, that a lady of one man refused Should therefore be abused by another!
Lysander, look how I shake with fear!
what, gone?
Lysander!
lord!
What, can’t hear me?
Gone?
No sound, no word?
O my, where are you?
Speak, if you hear me; Speak, of all loves!
I almost faint with fear.
No?—then I can see that you’re not near.
I'll find either death or you immediately. 
Are we all here?
Ready, ready; and here's a marvelously convenient place for our rehearsal.
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn bush our dressing room, and we will do it just as we will do it before the duke.
Peter Quince— What do you say, bully Bottom?
There are things in this comedy of “Pyramus and Thisbe” that will never please an audience.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot stand.
What do you think about that?
Damn, a risky business.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is said and done.
This will keep them from being frightened.
No, make it two lines more.
Won’t the ladies be afraid of the lion?
I’m afraid so, I promise you.
Well then, another prologue must say that he is not really a lion.
You must tell his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck, and he himself must speak through the mask saying this, or something to the same defect,—"Ladies," or "Fair ladies, I would wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you, not to be afraid, not to tremble.
my life for yours.
If you think I come here as a lion, shame on me.
Well, OK.
But there are two more hard things, that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber, because, as you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
Does the moon shine that night we play our play?
A calendar, a calendar!
Yes, it does shine that night.
Why, then may you leave a panel of the great chamber-window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at that panel.
Ay, or else someone must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to imitate or to present the person of moonshine.
Some man or other must look like a wall, and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast cement around him to signify the wall, and let him hold his fingers open like this, and through that cranny, Pyramus and Thisbe will whisper.
If that can be done, then I think we’ve covered everything.
Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
What woven country-folk do we have swaggering here, So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play!
I'll listen, be An actor too perhaps, if I see a place to jump in.
Must I speak now?
Ay, darn it, you must because you must understand he only Goes to see a noise that he heard, and will come again.
You speak your whole part all at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter.
Oh strange!
We are attacked by ghosts.
Let’s go, guys!
Help!
I'll follow you; I'll lead you in a circle, Through bog, through bush, through more bushes, through brier; Sometimes I’ll be a horse, sometimes a hound dog, A hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire; And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
Why do they run away?
This is a bad joke of theirs to frighten me.
Oh Bottom, you are changed!
What do I see on you?
What do you see?
You see an donkey-head of your own, do you?
This is to make a donkey of me, to frighten me, if they can.
The black rooster, so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The thrush with his note so true, The wren with little quill.
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
So my eye is very attracted to your shape; And your fair virtue's force violently moves me, On the first look of you, to say, to swear, I love you.
The more’s the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends.
No, I can only make a joke for a specific occasion.
You are as wise as you are beautiful.
I am a spirit of no simple power— The summer still waits for me And I love you.
Moth!
and Mustardseed!
Ready.
And I.
And I.
And I.
Where shall we go?
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; Jump into his steps as he walks and dance in his eyes; Feed him apricots and dewberries, Purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries; Steal the honey bags from the bumblebees, And, for night lights, cut their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, In order to have my love go to sleep and wake up, And pluck the wings from painted butterflies, To fan the moonbeams out of sleeping eyes.
Greet him, elves, and do him courtesies.
Hail, mortal!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
I beg your honors’ mercy, heartily.—What is your name?
Cobweb.
I would like to get to know you better, good Master Cobweb.
Peasblossom.
Mustardseed.
Good Master Mustardseed, I know you well.
That same cowardly giant-like roast beef has devoured many people from your family.
I promise you your relatives have made my eyes water before now.
I want to get to know you as well, good Master Mustardseed.
Come on, wait on him; lead him to my private apartment.
The moon, I think, looks as if she has watery eyes, And when she weeps, every little flower weeps, Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Cover his mouth, bring him silently. 
I wonder if Titania is up yet, And what it was that next came into her sight, Which she must love in the extreme.
What’s going on now about this haunted grove?
My mistress is in love with a monster.
Near to her close and consecrated private place, While she was sleeping, A crew of actors, rude mechanicals, That work for bread near Athenian shops, Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' wedding day.
The stupidest man of these dim country-folk Who acted Pyramus in their rehearsal, Exited from his scene and entered in a bunch of bushes, When I took advantage of him And I fixed donkey's head on his head.
Then, his Thisbe must be answered, And my creation comes back to the rehearsal.
Their senses thus weakened, lost within their strong fears, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong, Because briers and thorns catch their clothes, Some sleeves, some hats.
This works out better than I could have planned.
But have you touched the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice yet, as I told you to?
I did it while he was sleeping,—that is finished too,— And the Athenian woman by his side, So that, when he woke up, she must, of course, be the first he saw.
Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
This is the woman, but not this the man.
Oh, why do you reject him that loves you so?
Say these bitter things to your bitter foe.
Now I only scold, but I should give you worse; Because you, I fear, has given me cause to curse.
If you have slain Lysander in his sleep, Being in blood over your shoes, plunge the knife Deep into me and kill me too.
The sun was not as true to the daytime As he was to me.
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?
I'd believe as quickly that This whole earth may be bored, and that the moon May creep through the centre and so disrupt Her brother's noontide with the other side of the world.
It can only mean that you have murdered him; A murderer should look like you, so dead, so grim.
What's this got to do with my Lysander?
Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, will you give him to me?
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
Get out, dog!
Get out, low-life!
You drive me past the bounds Of a maiden's patience.
Have you slain him, then?
Oh!
For once tell the truth; tell the truth, even for my sake.
Did you dare to look at him, being awake, And have you killed him sleeping?
Oh brave touch!
Couldn’t a worm, a poisonous snake, do as much?
I am not guilty of killing Lysander; And he isn’t dead, as far as I can tell.
I beg you, tell me, then, that he is well.
And if I could, what should I get for saying so?
You will see me no more, whether he be dead or not.
So sorrow's heaviness does heavier grow Because my sleep has been interrupted.
What have you done?
You have made a major mistake, And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
Some true love turned false must follow because of your mistake, And not a false love turned true.
Then fate overrules me, that, as one man keeping his promise, A million fail in keeping theirs, confusing oath on oath.
I go, I go; look how I go,— Swifter than an arrow from the barbarian’s bow.
Flower with this purple dye, Hit by Cupid's arrow, Sink into the apple of his eye!
Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand, And the youth mistaken by me Pleading for her love; Shall we watch what they’re doing?
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; Lord, what fools these mortals be!
Stand aside.
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.
Why should you think that I should not court you seriously?
You cannot find scorn and derision in tears of love.
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows that are born in tears Show the whole truth at that moment.
How can these things in me seem like ridicule to you, When my tears prove them to be true?
You move your cunning ahead more and more.
When truth kills truth, oh devilish-holy fight!
These vows are Hermia's.
Will you give her up?
I had no sense of judgment when I swore love to her.
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her up.
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.
What, my love, shall I compare your eyes to?
Crystal is muddy.
Oh, how ripe your lips are, Those kissing cherries grow tempting!
When you hold up your hand that pure congealed white top, High Taurus' snow, fanned with the eastern wind, Turns to a crow.
Oh, let me kiss This princess hand of pure white, this seal of bliss!
Oh spite!
Oh hell!
I see you all are bent To set against me for your entertainment.
If you were civil and had any manners, You wouldn’t insult me so much like this.
Can’t you just hate me, as I know you do, Instead of joining together to mock me too?
If you were men, as you are men on the outside, You wouldn’t use a gentle lady like this: To vow, and swear, and super-praise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals and love Hermia; And now both rivals to mock Helena.
A really good exploit, a manly enterprise, To bring up tears in a poor maid's eyes With your insults!
None of the noble sort Would so offend a virgin and try A poor soul's patience, all to make you laugh.
You are unkind, Demetrius; don’t be like that, Because you love Hermia.
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
Lysander, keep your Hermia; I will have none of her.
If I ever loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart journeyed to her only like a guest, And now has returned home to Helena, There to remain.
Helena, it’s not true.
But why did you leave me so unkindly?
Why should he stay whom love presses to go?
What love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander's love, that would not let him wait,— Fair Helena,—who makes the night more golden Than all the fiery rays and eyes of light.
Why are you looking for me?
Couldn’t this make you know That the hate I have for you made me leave you like that?
You don’t speak as you think; it cannot be.
Wow, she is one of this conspiracy!
Now I see that all three have gotten together To design this false joke in spite of me.
Insulting Hermia!
Most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you contrived with these men To bait me with this disgusting insult?
Is all the conversation that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have scolded the clock For parting us,—Oh, is it all forgotten?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have created both one flower with our needles, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key; As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporated into one.
And will you tear our ancient love apart To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me, and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,— Who even just a minute ago spurned me with his foot,— To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?
Why does he speak this To me whom he hates?
and why does Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And give me, indeed, affection, Except by your putting them up to it, by your consent?
Although I may not be as graceful as you, So hung upon with love, so fortunate, But most miserable most, to love and still be unloved?
You should pity rather than despise this situation.
I don’t understand what you mean by this.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument.
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my reason; My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
Oh excellent!
Sweet, don’t scorn her like that.
If she cannot beg, I can order.
You can order no more than she can beg; Your threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— Helena, I love you; by my life I do; I swear, by that which I will lose for you, To prove him a liar that says I don’t love you.
I say I love you more than he does.
If you say so, go away, and prove it too.
Away, you black giant!
You are a tame man; go!
Why have you become so rude?
What change is this, Sweet love?
Your love!
Get out, tawny barbarian, out!
Out, loathed medicine!
Hated potion, get away!
You aren’t joking?
Yes, truly, and so do you.
Demetrius, I will keep my word with you.
I wish I had your guarantee, because I see that A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her like that.
What!
can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me!
why?
Oh me!
what news, my love?
Aren’t I Hermia?
Aren’t you Lysander?
Why then, you left me,—Oh, the gods forbid!— Seriously, shall I say?
Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt, Be certain, nothing truer; it’s no joke That I do hate you and love Helena.
Oh me!
You juggler!
you rotten scoundrel!
You thief of love!
What!
have you come by night, And stolen my love's heart from him?
Fine, OK!
Don’t you have any modesty, any maiden shame, Any touch of bashfulness?
What!
will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
shame on you!, shame on you!!
You counterfeit, you puppet, you!
OK, so that’s the way the game goes.
How low am I, you painted maypole?
I am not yet so low That my nails can’t reach yours eyes.
I beg you, although you mock me, gentlemen, Don’t let her hurt me.
I was never cursed; I have no gift at all in being a fighter; I am a right maid for my cowardice; Don’t let her strike me.
You may think, perhaps, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her movements.
Good Hermia, don’t be so angry with me.
I always loved you, Hermia; Always kept your counsels; never wronged you; Except that, because of my love for Demetrius, I told him of your running away into this forest.
Let me go.
You see how simple and how in love I am.
Why, get going.
Who’s stopping you?
A foolish heart that I’m leaving behind here.
What!
with Lysander?
With Demetrius.
Don’t be afraid; she shall not harm you, Helena.
No, sir, she shall not, although you take her side.
Little again!
Let me get her.
Get going, you dwarf; You zero, made of scraps of grass; You bead, you acorn.
You are too over-zealous On her behalf that rejects your services.
Follow!
No, I'll go with you, cheek by jowl.
You, mistress, all this trouble is because of you.
No, don’t go back.
I will not trust you, I won’t; And I’ll stay in your cursed company no longer.
Your hands are quicker than mine for a fight; My legs are longer, though, to run away.
I am amazed, and don’t know what to say.
This is your negligence.
Either you are really mistaken, Or you commit these errors willfully.
Believe me, king of shadows, I was really mistaken.
Didn’t you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on?
And so far I am glad it worked out this way, Because I am really enjoying the show.
Do you see that these lovers are looking for a place to fight?
Get going, then, Robin, make the night darker; Cover the stars in the sky With drooping fog, as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray That they will not come within another's way.
Sometimes, imitate Lysander’s voice, To stir up Demetrius’ anger; And sometimes, sound like Demetrius; And that way you can lead them from each other, Until sleep imitating death creeps over their eyebrows With leaden legs and batty wings.
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye; Its juice has the virtuous property Of removing all error from his eyes And will make his eyeballs roll with correct sight.
When they next wake up, all this conflict Shall seem to be a dream and a worthless vision; And back to Athens the lovers shall go With happiness and agreement that will never end.
While I use you to solve this affair, I'll go to my queen, and beg the Indian boy from her; And then I will release her charmed eye So that she will see the monster, and all things shall be at peace.
My fairy lord, this must be done very quickly, Because night is quickly coming to an end; And over there is the first hint of morning sunlight, Which, when it is seen by ghosts wandering here and there, They all troop home to the graveyards.
Up and down, up and down; I will lead them up and down.
The field and town are afraid of me.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.
Where are you, proud Demetrius?
Speak now.
Here, villain, drawn and ready.
Where are you?
I’ll be right with you.
Follow me, then, To a clear place.
You runaway, you coward, have you run away?
Speak.
Are you hiding in some bush?
Where are you?
You coward, are you bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that you look for wars, But will not fight one?
Come on, lazy loafer; come on, you child; I'll whip you with a rod.
If someone else kills you, He will be cursed.
Hey, are you there?
Follow my voice; we won’t test your manhood here.
He went before me, and still dares me to fight; When I get to where he’s calling from, he’s gone.
Welcome, gentle day!
Because, even if you only shine your grey light one time, I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Coward, why don’t you come?
Wait for me, if you dare; Because I know well That you are running before me, moving from place to place, Not daring to stand still or look me in the face.
Where are you?
Come over here; I am here.
No, then, you are making fun of me.
Oh weary night, Oh long and tedious night, Cut your hours short!
Only three?
Come on, one more; Two boys and two girls makes up four.
I have never been so weary, never so sad, Wet from the dew, and torn with briers; I can’t crawl any further.
Here I’ll rest until daybreak.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they really mean to fight!
Come, sit down on this flowery bed, While I play with your amiable cheeks, And stick musk-roses in your sleek smooth head, And kiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.
Where's Peasblossom?
Ready.
Ready.
Mr. Cobweb; good monsieur, get all your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me his honey-bag.
Ready.
Give me your hand, Mr. Mustardseed.
I beg you, stop making curtsies, good sir.
What can I do for you?
Nothing, good sir, but for you to help Mr. Cobweb scratch my head.
I have to get to the barber's, sir, because I think I have an awful lot of hair on my face, and I am such a sensitive donkey, that I must scratch even if my hair only tickles me a little.
Will you hear some music, my sweet love?
I have a reasonable good musical ear; let’s sing and dance.
Or say, sweet love, what you desire to eat.
Truly, a peck of dry food; I could munch your good dry oats.
I think I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.
Good hay, sweet hay, has no equal.
I have an adventurous fairy that shall seek What the squirrel has been hoarding, and get you new nuts.
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I beg you, don’t let any of your people wake me up; I feel a deep sleep coming.
You sleep, and I will hold you in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and stay away.
I will put my arms around you just as the woodbine twists around the sweet honeysuckle,— like the female ivy Winds around the branches of the elm.
Oh, how I love you!
how I adore on you!
Welcome, good Robin.
Do you see this sweet sight?
She had put a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers All around his hairy face, And that same dew, which sometimes was accustomed To swell like round and orient pearls on the buds, Was now within the pretty flowers' eyes, Like tears that were crying about their own sins.
When, at my pleasure, I had teased her, And she, calmly, begged my patience, I asked her for the Indian child, Which she gave me Right away, and sent her fairy To carry him to my private place in fairy-land.
And now that I have the boy, I will undo This hateful spell that I have put on her eyes.
And, gentle Puck, take this donkey head Off the head of this Athenian lover, That when he wakes when the others do, All of them may go back to Athens, Thinking no more about tonight’s events than That they were parts of a dream.
But first, I will release the fairy queen.
Be as you are accustomed to being; See as you are accustomed to seeing.
The bud from the Moon-goddess’ plant Has such force and blessed power over Cupid's flower.
Now, my Titania, wake up, my sweet queen.
My Oberon!
What visions have I seen!
I thought I was in love with a donkey.
Your “love” is lying there.
How did all this happen?
Quiet for awhile.—Robin, take off this head.
Titania, call for music, and strike the senses of all these five so that they seem more dead than sleeping.
Now when you awake, see with yours own fool's eyes.
Sound, music.
Come, my queen, hold hands with me, And rock the ground where these sleepers are.
Now you and I have a new friendship, And will solemnly dance In Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, Tomorrow at midnight And bless it for all fair prosperity.
There the pairs of faithful lovers shall be Married, with Theseus, all in jollity.
Fairy king, see and listen; I do hear the morning lark.
Then, my queen, in sad silence, We dance after night's darkness.
We go around the globe, Swifter than the wandering moon.
Come, my lord; and, as we fly, Tell me how it happened this night That I was found here sleeping On the ground with these mortals.
I never heard Such gallant scolding; because, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed to have one mutual cry.
I never heard So musical a noise, such sweet thunder.
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So jawed, so sandy-colored, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep along the ground; Crook-kneed and dew-covered like Thessaly bulls; Slow in pursuit, but matched in their barks like bells, Each one under the other.
A cry more tuneable Was never called to, or cheered with a horn, In Crete, in Sparta, or in Thessaly.
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep; And this Lysander; this Demetrius is; This Helena, old Nedar's Helena.
I wonder why they are here together.
It is, my lord.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them up by blowing the horns.
Good morning, friends.
Saint Valentine’s Day is past; Do these forest-birds begin only now to make a couple?
Pardon, my lord.
I beg you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies; How does this gentle concord in the world come about, That hatred is so far from jealousy That you can sleep without fear?
Our intention Was to be gone from Athens, and to get to a place Where we might be together without the Punishment of the Athenian law.
My lord, fair Helena told me of their running away, And why they ran here to this forest; And in fury, I followed them here, Fair Helena, in love, following me.
I was engaged to her, my lord, Before I saw Hermia.
But, like a sickness, I hated the taste this food; But, now healthy, my natural tastes restored, Now I wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it.
Fair lovers, it’s good that we found you here.
We will hear more of this story later.— Egeus, I will override your demands; These couples shall eternally be knit By and by with us in the temple.
These things seem small and murky, Like far-off mountain tops turned into clouds.
I think I see these things with unfocused eyes, As when every thing seems double.
Yes, and my father.
And Hippolyta.
And he did bid us to follow him to the temple, didn’t he?
When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
My next is 'Most fair Pyramus.
Heigh-ho!—Peter Quince!
Flute, the bellows-mender!
Snout, the tinker!
Starveling!
Oh my God, they have run away and left me asleep!
I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream— it’s beyond the smartest man to say what kind of dream it was.—Man is only a donkey if he goes about to telling this dream.
I thought I was—there is no man can tell what.
I thought I was, and I thought I had,—but a man is only a mended fool, if he will offer to say what I thought I had.
The eye of man has not heard, the ear of man has not seen; man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, or his heart to report, what my dream was.
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.
It shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it has no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke.
Perhaps, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. 
Have you sent someone to Bottom's house?
Has he come home yet?
No one has heard anything about him.
No doubt, he’s kidnapped.
If he doesn’t come, then the play is incomplete; it doesn’t go on, does it?
It’s not possible.
There’s not a man in all Athens able to play Pyramus but he.
No, he has simply the best wit of any working man in Athens.
You must say “paragon.” A “paramour” is, God bless us, a thing of nothing.
Sirs, the duke is coming from the temple; and there are two or three lords and ladies more married.
If our play had gone forward, we would’ve all been made men.
Oh sweet bully Bottom!
Six cents a-day in Pyramus, or nothing.
Where are these lads?
Where are these hearts?
Bottom!—Oh most courageous day!
Oh most happy hour!
I will tell you everything, just as it happened.
Let’s hear it, sweet Bottom.
Not a word from me.
All that I will tell you is, that the duke has dined.
Get your costumes together; good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your shoes; meet presently at the palace; every man look over his part; for the short and the long of it is, they want to see our play.
In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and don’t let him that plays the lion cut his nails, because they shall hang out for the lion's claws.
And, most dear actors, don’t eat any onions nor garlic, because we are to utter our lines with sweet breath; And I don’t doubt that we will hear them say it is a sweet comedy.
No more words.
It’s strange, my Theseus, the story that these lovers speak of.
More strange than true.
I never may believe These antique fables, or these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such busy brains, Such ability to shape fantasies, that they catch More than cool reason ever understands.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are all compact in their imagination.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold; That is the madman.
The lover, just as crazy, Sees Helen of Troy's beauty in an Egyptian.
The poet's eye, rolling in a fine frenzy, Glances from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And as imagination sends out The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives a local place and a name To airy nothing.
Such tricks have strong imagination, That, if it would only catch some joy, It understands some bringer of that joy; Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush thought to be a bear?
But the whole story of the night told over, And all their minds changed all at the same time, Shows more witnesses than just images of the mind, And grows to something of great lasting; But, nevertheless, strange and admirable.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.— Joy, gentle friends!
Joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts!
More than you wish for us Waits in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
Come now; what plays, what dances shall we have, To pass the three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in store?
Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.
Say, what entertainment do you have for this evening?
What play?
what music?
How shall we spend The lazy time, if not with some delight?
There is a brief list of how many events there are; Make choice of which your highness will see first.
tedious and brief!
That’s like hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play; But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious, because, in all the play There is not one appropriate word, one player a good actor.
Who are they that do play it?
Hard working men that work here in Athens, Who never worked in their minds until now, And now they have toiled their bad memories To do this play in honor of your wedding.
And we’ll hear it.
No, my noble lord, It is not for you.
I’ve heard, And it is nothing, nothing in the world, Unless you can laugh at their intentions, Extremely stretched and done with cruel pain, To do you service.
I will hear that play, Because nothing can ever be wrong When simpleness and duty give it freely.
I don’t like to see misery over-played, And duty dying in his service.
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
He says they can’t do anything like this.
That makes us kinder, to give them thanks for nothing.
And what poor duty can’t do, Noble respect takes it in force, not merit.
In places I go to, great clerks have purposed To greet me with prepared welcomes; I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make full stops in the middle of sentences, Mess up their practiced speeches in their fears, And, in conclusion, stop all together, dumbstruck, Not paying me a welcome.
Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence, I still picked out a welcome; And in the modesty of fearful duty, I can understand as much as if it were from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity Speaking the least means most to me.
So please your grace, the prologue is next.
Let him approach.
If we offend you, it is with our good will.
But you should think that we don’t come to offend, But with good will.
To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then that we come but in scorn.
We don’t come, as we mean to content you, Is our true intent.
All for your delight We are not here.
He has ridden his prologue like a rough colt.
Indeed he has played on this prologue like a child on a recorder, a sound, but not in order.
His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all disordered.
Who’s next?
Gentles, perhaps you wonder at this show; But wonder on until the truth makes all things clear.
This man is Pyramus, if you want to know; This beauteous lady is certainly Thisbe.
This man, with lantern, dog, and thorn bush, Represents Moonshine, because, if you want to know, These lovers think it’s no shame to meet at Ninus' tomb By moonshine, there, there to court each other.
This grisly beast, which known by name Lion, Scared away or rather frightened the trusty Thisbe, Coming first to the place by night; And as she fled, she dropped her shawl, Which vile Lion stained with his bloody mouth.
For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and the two lovers, Tell you while they stay here.
I wonder if the lion is going to speak.
Do you need lime and hair to speak better?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard speak, my lord.
Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
Oh grim-looked night!
Oh night with hue so black!
Oh night, which ever is when day is not!
Thanks, courteous wall.
Jove protect you well for this!
But what see what see I?
I don’t see Thisbe.
Oh wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss, Cursed be your stones for deceiving me like this!
The wall, I think, being sensible, should curse again.
No, in truth, sir, he should not.
Deceiving me” is Thisbe's cue.
She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.
You shall see it will fall right just as I told you.—she comes From over there.
Oh wall, you have heard my moans very often, For separating my fair Pyramus and me.
I see a voice; now I’ll go to the chink, To spy if I can hear my Thisbe's face.
Thisbe!
My love!
you are my love, I think.
Think what you will, I am your lover's grace; And like Limander, I am still trusty.
And I’m like Helena, until the fates kill me.
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
As Shafalus to Procrus, I am to you.
Oh, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
Will you meet me straightway at Ninny's tomb?
Fighting life, fighting death, I come without delay.
So I, wall, have discharged my part; And, being done, Wall goes away like this.
Now is the wall down between the two neighbors.
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without warning.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
The best plays are only shadows, and the worst are no worse, if imagination can fill in the gaps.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
If we imagine no worse of them than they imagine of themselves, they may pass for excellent men.
Here come two noble beasts, a moon and a lion.
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now, perhaps, both quake and tremble here, When a rough lion roars in wildest rage.
A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
The very best at a beast, my lord, that ever I saw.
This lion is a very fox for his courage.
True and a goose for his secret-keeping.
Not so, my lord, because his courage cannot carry his secret-keeping, but the fox carries the goose.
His secret-keeping, I am sure, cannot carry his courage, because the goose cannot carry the fox.
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circle.
This lantern represents the horned moon; I myself seem to be the man in the moon.
How else is it the man in the moon?
He doesn’t dare come there for the candle, because you see, it’s already out.
I am weary of this moon.
I wish he would change!
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is growing dark, but still, politely, in all reason, we must pass the time.
Proceed, moon.
All that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these are in the moon.
But silence; here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny's tomb.
Where is my love?
Well run, Thisbe.
Well moused, lion.
And here comes Pyramus.
And then the lion vanishes.
But stay;—Oh spite!
But mark,—poor knight, What dreadful sorrow is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
Oh dainty duck!
Oh dear!
Your shawl good, What!
stained with blood?
Approach, you vicious fates!
Oh fates!
come, come; Cut thread and thrum; Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go far In making a man look sad.
Curse my heart, but I pity the man.
Oh why, nature, did you make lions?
Since the vile lion vile has here taken my dear; Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer.
Come, tears, confound; Out, sword, and wound The pap (heart) of Pyramus.
Ay, that left pap, Where the heart beats.— Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead, Now am I fled; My soul is in the sky.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
No die, but an ace, for him, because he is only one.
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove a donkey.
How is it that moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
A particle of dust will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better.
She has already seen him with those sweet eyes.
And thus she moans, that is to say.— Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
Oh Pyramus, arise, Speak, speak.
Quite dumb?
Dead, dead?
A tomb Must cover your sweet eyes.
Oh Sisters Three, Come, come to me, With hands as pale as milk; Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
Moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead.
Ay, and wall too.
No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers.
Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear an Italian country dance between two of our company?
No epilogue, I beg you, because your play needs no excuse.
Never excuse, for when the players are all dead, there’s no one to be blamed.
God, if he who wrote the play had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.
And so it is, truly; and very notably acted.
But come, your Italian country dance; forget your epilogue.
I’m afraid we shall oversleep in the morning, As much as we stayed up late this night.
As you go through the house, use the dead and drowsy fire to give glimmering light, Every elf and fairy spirit Hop as lightly as bird hops from a thorn: And sing this little song, following me, And dance it as you sing it.
Now, until dawn, Each fairy wander through this house.
We will go to the best marriage-bed, Which shall be blessed by us; And the children created there Shall forever be lucky and prosperous.
Dance away: Don’t delay: All of you meet me by dawn.
If we actors have offended you, Think about this,--and everything will be all right,--you have only dozed off here While these visions appeared.
And this weak and idle play about love, Doesn’t mean any more than a dream.
So, good night to you all.
Let’s have your applause, if we are friends, And Robin shall make good on his promise. 
Rubbish!
Don’t tell me; I don’t like it at all That you, Iago, who has used my purse As if the strings were yours, should know about this.
but you’re not listening to me.
If I ever dreamt about such a matter, Hate me.
You told me you hated him.
Despise me, if I don’t.
Truly, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife; That has never led a squadron in the field, And doesn’t know the division of a battle any More than a spinster does, unless the theory books, In which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan As masterly as he can.
By heaven, I would rather have been his hangman.
Why, there's no remedy; it is the curse of the military.
Preference goes by who you know and who likes you, And not by old system, where each second person Took the first’s place.
Now, sir, judge it for yourself Whether or I am better suited in any beautiful terms To love the Moor.
I wouldn’t follow him then.
You shall see Many a duteous and knee-bending rogue That, doting on his own obedient slavery, Wears himself out, much like his master's ass, For nothing but dry oats; and when he's old, dismissed From the service.
I would whip such honest rogues.
There are others who, dressed in uniforms and faces of duty, that keep their hearts attending on themselves; And, throwing only shows of service to their lords, Thrive well by them, and when they have lined their coats, Do themselves homage.
These fellows have some soul; And someone like that is how I am.
Because, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
What great luck the thick lips have, If he can get away with this!
even if his joy is joy, Still throw such aggravation on it That he won’t stay happy for long.
Go ahead; yell with frightening accent and distress As when a fire Is seen in big cities at night and by accident.
What, ho, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!
Awake!
what, ho, Brabantio!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Look at your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Thieves!
Thieves!
What is the reason for this terrible summons?
What’s the matter there?
Signior, is your family all inside?
Are your doors locked?
Get up, I say.
What, have you lost your wits?
Very reverend Signior, do you know my voice?
No, who are you?
My name is Roderigo.
The worst welcome.
I have ordered you not to hang around my doors; In honest plainness, you have heard me say My daughter is not for you, and now, in madness, Being full of supper and drunk, You come, out of maliciousness To interrupt my sleep.
Sir, sir, sir, But you must certainly be sure that My spirit and my place have power in them To make this bitter to you.
Patience, good sir.
Why are you telling me about robbing?
this is Venice; My house is not a farm.
Very grave Brabantio, I come to you in simple and pure soul.
Zounds, sir, you are one of those who wouldn’t serve God if the devil asked you to.
Because we are servants, and you think we are ruffians, you'd have your daughter covered with a African horse; you'd have your nephews neigh to you; you'd have chargers for cousins and small Spanish horses for Germans.
Who the hell are you?
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making a Satan.
You are a villain.
You are a senator.
Sir, I will answer anything.
Give me a candle!
Wake up all my servants!
Farewell; because I must leave you.
It doesn’t seem right or suitable to my position To be a witness (which I will be if I stay), Against the Moor.
because I know the government, No matter how angry this makes Brabantio with some Argument, cannot arrest him safely; because he's Embarked with such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, Which is being discussed even now, that, to save their Souls, they have no one of his depth To lead their armies, in which regard, Although I hate him as I hate hell pains, I must still show a flag and sign of love, To preserve my present life, Which is indeed only sign.
So that you shall surely find him, lead these searchers to the Sagittary Inn, And I will be there with him.
So, farewell.
How did you know it was she?
Get more Candles; Wake up all my relatives.
Do you think they’re married?
Truly, I think they are.
How did she get out?
O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from now on don’t believe you can know your daughters' minds from the way you see them act.
Haven’t you read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Call my brother.
Do you know Where we may catch her and the Moor?
I think I can find him, if you’d please Get a good guard, and go along with me.
I beg you, lead on.
Although I have slain men during a war, I believe it is a grave matter of the conscience To do a premeditated murder.
I don’t have evil in me Sometimes to do me service.
Nine or ten times I had thought to have stabbed him here under the ribs.
It is better as it is.
No, but he chattered on, And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor, That, with the little godliness I have, I worked hard to tolerate him.
But, I beg you, sir, Are you really married?
Be assured of this, That the magnifico is very popular; And has, in his office, a voice equal To twice the duke's.
he will divorce you; Or apply to you what restraint and grievance The law will allow him to do, With all his might to do it.
Let him do his worse.
My services that I have done for the signiory Shall out-shout his complaints.
But, look!
what lights are coming?
Those are the awakened father and his friends.
You had better go in.
Is it they?
By Janus, I don’t think so.
The goodness of the night on you, friends!
What’s the news?
The duke greets you, general; And he requires your super-speedy appearance This instant.
What’s the matter, do you think?
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequential messengers This very night at one another's heels; And many of the consuls, awakened and meeting, Are at the duke's already.
You have been hotly called for; When, you weren’t found at your lodging, The senate sent about three different requests To search for you.
It is good that you found me.
I will only say one more word here in the house, And I’ll go with you.
Ensign, what is he doing here?
I don’t understand.
He's married.
To whom?
By Mary, to… Come, captain, will you go?
Let’s go.
Here comes another group to see for you.
General, be careful; He comes with bad intentions.
Stop!
Stop there!
Signior, it is the Moor.
You, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I will fight you.
O you foul thief, where have you hidden my daughter?
Damned as you are, you have cast a spell on her; Because I'll restore myself to all things of sense, If she wasn’t bound in chains of magic, Would a maid so tender, beautiful, and happy, So opposed to marriage that she shunned The wealthy, curled darlings of our country, Would she ever have, to merit a public joke, Run from her father to the black bosom Of a thing such as you, to fear, not to delight in?
I therefore arrest and attack you As an abuser of the world, a practitioner Of the forbidden and illegal arts.
If he resists, Subdue him at his peril.
To prison until the right time Of law and course of justice Call you to answer.
What if I obey?
How may the duke be satisfied with that, Whose messengers are here by my side, On some urgent business of the state, To bring me to him?
It is true, very worthy Signior; The duke's in council, and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
What!
The duke in council!
The duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Can only feel this wrong as if it were their own; Because if such actions may have passage free, Bond slaves and pagans shall be our statesmen. 
There is no written in this news That makes them believable.
Indeed, they are out of proportion; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
And mine a hundred and forty.
And mine two hundred.
What, ho!
what, ho!
what, ho!
A messenger from the galleys.
Now, what's the latest?
The Turkish armies are headed for Rhodes; So I was asked to report here to the state By Signior Angelo.
What do you say about this change?
No, in all confidence, the Turks are not going to Rhodes.
Here is more news.
The Ottoman, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have joined a later fleet there with them.
Yes, so I thought.
How many, do you guess?
Signior Montano, Your trusty and very valiant servant, Salutes you like this, with his free duty, And begs you to believe him.
It is certain, then, for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, isn’t he in town?
He's now in Florence.
Write to him from us; send it very, very quickly.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Valiant Othello, we must straight send you Against the general enemy Ottoman.
I didn’t see you; welcome, gentle Signior; We missed your advice and your help tonight.
And I missed yours.
Why, what's the matter?
My daughter!
O, my daughter!
Dead?
Whoever he is that, in this disgusting event, Has tricked your daughter of herself like this, And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall read yourself to the bitter letter of it As you see fit.
Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor; who now, it seems, Has been brought here by Your special mandate for the state affairs.
We are very sorry for it .
What, in your own part, can you say to this?
Nothing, but that this is so.
Very potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approved good masters, That I have taken away this old man's daughter, Is very true; true, I have married her.
I don’t speak well, And I am little blessed with the soft phrase of peace Because, since these arms of mine were seven years' old, until now some nine months past, they have used Their dearest actions on the battlefield; And I can speak little of this great world, Only what relates to feats of war and battle; And therefore I shall grace my cause little By speaking for myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience, I will deliver a round truthful tale Of my whole course of love, by what drugs, what charms, What invocation, and what mighty magic, Because I am charged with such crimes, I won his daughter.
A maiden never bold, Of a spirit so still and quiet that she blushed at her own Movements; and she, in spite of nature, Of years, of country, reputation, everything, To fall in love with what she feared to look at!
I therefore testify again, That he worked on her with some mixtures powerful over the blood, Or with some dram that produced this effect.
To testify is not proof, Without wider and more open tests Than these thin habits and poor probabilities Of modern liking prefer against him.
But, Othello, speak.
Did you, by indirect and forced methods, Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or did she ask for them, with such a beautiful question As soul to soul allows?
Fetch Desdemona here.
Ensign, go with them; you know the place best.
And, until she comes, as truly as I confess the vices of my blood to heaven, So I'll present truthfully, to your hearing, How I thrived in this beautiful lady's love, And she in mine.
Tell it, Othello.
Her father loved me, often invited me; Still questioned me the story of my life, From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have been in.
To hear this, Desdemona would seriously listen, But still the house affairs would draw her away, Which she would finish in a great hurry, and She’d come again, and eat up my stories With a greedy ear, which I observing, Once I took a rare hour; and found good ways To draw a prayer of earnest enthusiasm from her So that I would lengthen all my stories, Which she had already heard bits and pieces of, But not all of them.
I agreed And often I cheated her of her tears, When I spoke of some distressful event I had suffered in my youth.
This is the only witchcraft I have used.
Here comes the lady; let her verify it.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
My noble father, I see a divided duty here.
To you I am bound for my life and education; My life and education both teach me How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, I am therefore your daughter.
But here's my husband; And as much duty as my mother showed To you, preferring you before her father, So much I dispute that I may profess Due to the Moor, my lord.
God be with you!
I’m done.
For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child, Because your escape would teach me tyranny, To hang logs on them.
I’m done, my lord.
Let me speak as you would; and lay a sentence Which, as a grace or step, may help these lovers Into your favor.
When remedies are too late, griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which hopes lately depended on.
To mourn mischief that is over and gone Is the next way to create new mischief.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes it, Patience makes a mockery of her injury.
The victim that smiles steals something from the thief; He robs himself that spends a unprofitable grief.
These sentences, to sweetness or to bitterness, Being strong on both sides, are equal.
I humbly beg you, proceed to the affairs of state.
The Turk with very mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
Othello, the strength of the place is best known to you; and although we have there a force that is more than adequate, yet public opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, say we need a safer voice, like you.
You must therefore be content to conceal the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and violent expedition.
The dictator, custom, very grave senators, Has made the stone and steel couch of war My feather bed three times.
I recognize A natural and prompt speed that I find in hardness, and undertake These present wars against the Ottoman.
Very humbly, therefore, bowing to your state, I’d like proper provisions for my wife, Proper respect for housing and subsidy, With such accommodation and suitable company As is equal with her breeding.
Nor I.
Nor I. I would not live there, To put my father into violent thoughts, By being always in his sight.
Very gracious duke, Listen with a gracious ear to my request, And let me find a contract in your voice To assist my simpleness.
What would you have, Desdemona?
That I loved the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May shout to the world.
So much so, dear lords, if I am left behind, A moth of peace, and he goes to the war, The rites for which I love him I am deprived of, And I shall endure a sad interval caused By his dear absence.
Let me go with him.
Let her have your votes.
No, when light-winged toys Of feathered Cupid blind my knowing and Usual instruments of sight with unruly dullness, That if my games corrupt and stain my work, Let housewives make a skillet of my helmet, And all indignities and base adversities Make a boil of my reputation!
Tonight, my lord?
This night.
With all my heart.
At nine in the morning, we'll meet here again.
Othello, leave some officer behind, And he shall bring our commission to you, With such things of quality and respect As are important to you.
Let it be so.
Good night to everyone.
And, noble Signior, If virtue is missing delightful beauty, Your son-in-law is far more just than black.
Goodbye, brave Moor; be kind to Desdemona.
My life on her faith in me!
Iago?
What do you say, noble heart?
What will I do, do you think?
Why, go to bed and sleep.
I will drown myself immediately.
If you do, I shall never love you after.
Why, you silly gentleman!
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then we have a prescription to die when death is our physician.
O villainous!
I have looked on the world for twenty eight years, and since I could distinguish between a benefit and a disadvantage, I’ve never found man that knew how to love himself.
Before I would say I would drown myself for the love of a chicken, I would exchange my humanity with a baboon.
What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so crazy in love, but it is not in my virtue to fix it.
Virtue!
A fig!
It is in ourselves that we are like this or like that.
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to balance another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would lead us to very preposterous conclusions.
It cannot be.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will.
Come, be a man.
drown yourself!
Drown cats and blind puppies.
Put money in your purse; follow the wars; defeat your mood with an false beard; I say, put money in your purse.
It had a violent beginning, and you shall see an answerable separation— put only money in your purse.—These Moors are changeable in their wills.
Fill your purse with money.
The food that is now as luscious as locusts to him shall be shortly be as bitter as the bitter apple drug.
If you must damn yourself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.
A pox on drowning yourself!
It is clean out of the way.
Rather seek to be hanged in planning your joy than to be drowned and go without her.
Will you be committed to my hopes, if I depend on you?
I have told you often, and I’ll tell you again and again, I hate the Moor.
My cause is fixed in my heart; yours has no less reason.
Let us be united in our revenge against him.
If you can get his wife, you do yourself a pleasure, me a sport.
There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Go ahead; go; provide your money.
We will talk about this more of this tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Where shall we meet in the morning?
At my lodging.
I'll be with you soon.
Go to; farewell.
Do you hear me, Roderigo?
What did you say?
No more about drowning, do you hear?
This is the way I ever make my fool my purse; Because I should abuse my own gained knowledge If I would waste time with such a fool Only for my sport and profit.
I hate the Moor; And it is widely thought that he has done my job Between my sheets.
I don’t know if it is true; But I will take it as a certainty just because of mere Suspicion in that way.
He trusts me well, The better my plan will work on him.
Cassio's a proper man.
Let me see now, To get his place, and to congratulate myself In double trickery, How, how?
He has a person, and a smooth disposition, To be suspected, framed to make women lie.
The Moor is of a free and open nature, That thinks men are honest that only seem to be so; And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are.
I have it!
It is born.
Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. 
What can you discern at sea from the cape?
Nothing at all.
It is a very excited flood; I cannot, between the sky and the land, See a sail.
What shall we hear of this?
If the Turkish fleet is not Sheltered and in a bay, they are drowned; It is impossible to wait it out.
News, lads!
Our wars are over.
How!
Is this true?
I am glad of it.
He is a worthy governor But this same Cassio, although he speaks of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, he still looks sad, And prays the Moor is safe, because they were parted With an evil and violent tempest.
Pray heavens he is, Because I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier.
Come, let's do so, Because every minute is to expect More arrival.
Thank you, the valiant of this warlike isle, That so approve the Moor!
O, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, Because I have lost him on a dangerous sea!
Does he have a good ship?
His ship is heavily timbered, and his captain is Very experienced and has a good reputation; Therefore my hopes, not excessively fed to death, Stand in heavy anxiety.
A sail, a sail, a sail!
What noise?
The town is empty; on the seashore Ranks of people stand, and they cry, "A sail!
I beg you, sir, go outside, And give us truth about who it is that has arrived.
I shall.
But, good lieutenant, is your general married?
How now!
Who has put in?
It is one Iago, ensign to the general.
Who is she?
She that I spoke of, our great captain's captain, Left in the company of the bold Iago, Whose footing here occurs earlier than the seven nights We thought it would take.
Great Jove, guard Othello, And swell his sail with your own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Make love's quick breaths in Desdemona's arms, Give renewed fire to our dead spirits, And bring all Cyprus comfort!
O, behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore!
You men of Cyprus, bend your knees.
Hall to you, lady!
and the grace of heaven, Before you, behind you, and on every hand, Surround you!
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What news can you tell me of my lord?
He is not yet arrived and I don’t know anything Only that he's well, and will be here shortly.
O, but I fear how lost you each other?
The great fight of the sea and skies Separated our fellowship.
a sail.
Look for the news.
Good ensign, you are welcome.
Welcome, mistress.
Sir, I wish she would give you as much of her lips As she often gives me of her tongu., You'd have enough.
Alas, she has nothing to say.
By Mary, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her voice a little in her heart, And scolds by thinking.
You don’t have reasonto say so.
O, damn you, slanderer!
You shall not write my praise.
No, don’t let me.
What would you write about me, if you should praise me?
O gentle lady, don’t ask me, Because I am nothing if not critical.
Yes, madam.
I am not merry; but I cheat The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how would you praise me?
I am about it; but, indeed, my imagination Comes from my head as bird trap does from cloth, It plucks out brains and all.
But my inspiration works, And she is delivered like this.
If she is beautiful and wise, beauty and wit, The one's for use, the other uses it.
Well praised!
What if she is black and witty?
If she is black and also has a wit, She'll find a white that will her blackness fit.
Worse and worse.
What if she is beautiful and foolish?
She never was still foolish that was beautiful, Because even her folly helped her have an heir.
These are old wives’ tales to make fools laugh in the alehouse.
What miserable praise have you for her that's ugly and foolish?
You praise the worst best.
But what praise could you bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, rightly wore the witnessing of very malice itself?
To breastfeed fools and make a record of a little beer.
O very lame and powerless conclusion!
Don’t learn from him, Emilia, although he is your husband.
What do you think, Cassio?
Isn’t he a very unholy and rude counselor?
He speaks freely, madam.
You may appreciate him more as a soldier than as a scholar.
With a web as little as this, I’ll catch as big a fly as Cassio.
Yes, go ahead and smile on her; I will trap you in your own courtship.
You speak truly; it is so, indeed.
If such tricks as these strip you of your lieutenantry, it would’ve been better you hadn’t kissed your three fingers so often, with which you are again very ready to play the gent.
an excellent courtesy!
it is so, indeed.
Still your fingers to your lips again?
I wish they were hypodermics for your sake!
The Moor!
I know his trumpet.
It is truly so.
Let's meet him and greet him.
Look, where he is coming!
O my beautiful warrior!
My dear Othello!
It surprises me as much as my joy To see you here before me.
O my soul's joy!
If, after every storm such calms come, May the winds blow until they have awakened death!
And let the laboring ship climb hills of oceans As high as Olympus, and duck down again as low As hell is from heaven!
If I were to die now, I could die very happy; because, I’m afraid, My soul is so absolutely content, That no other comfort like this one Can follow unknown death.
The heavens forbid anything But our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days grow long!
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this contentment; It stops me here; it is too joyful.
O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll tighten the strings that make this music, Until it’s as honest as I am.
Come, let’s go to the castle.
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drowned.
Honey, Cyprus will be very glad to see you; I have found great love among them.
O my sweet, I chit-chat unfashionably, and I talk foolishly About my own comforts.
Come, Desdemona, Once more happily brought to Cyprus.
Meet me right away at the harbor.
Come here.
If you are valiant, as, they say, corrupt men being in love have a nobility in their natures that is more than natural to them, listen to me.
The lieutenant is part of the court’s guard tonight.
First, I must tell you this Desdemona is directly in love with him.
With him!
Why, it is not possible.
Lay your finger like this, and let your soul be instructed.
Watch with what violence she first loved the Moor, but with his bragging, and telling her fantastic lies.
will she still love him for chattering?
Don’t your discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed, and what joy will she have to look on the devil?
When the blood is made calm with playing, there should be something to fire it up again and to satisfy a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor; sympathy in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor lacks.
Now sir, this done, as it is a very compelling and natural position, who is outstanding and first in the degree of this luck as Cassio is?
A very changeable rogue, having no further conscience than assuming the mere form of civil and humane behavior, for the better measure of his worth and very hidden loose affections?
I cannot believe that in her; she is full of very blessed qualities.
Blessed my foot!
She drinks wine just like everyone else.
If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor.
Blessed pudding!
Didn’t you see her play with the palm of his hand?
Didn’t you see that?
Yes, I did; but she was only being polite.
I swear it’s a habitual lust, a list and hidden opening to the history of lust and evil thoughts.
They came so close with their lips that their breaths hugged each other.
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!
When these mutual things lead the way, the teacher and the main exercise follow close behind, to the obvious conclusion.
Piss off!
But, sir, Take my advice.
I have brought you from Venice.
Cassio doesn’t know you.
I won’t be far from you.
Find some occasion to make Cassio angry, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his discipline, or from whatever reason you please, which might be suggested by what’s happening at the time.
Provoke him so that he will; because even out of that, I will make these men of Cyprus rebel, whose character won’t come back to their original calmness unless Cassio is replaced.
So you shall have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I would now have to advance them; and the impediment very profitably removed, without which we couldn’t expect to succeed.
I guarantee you.
Meet me later at the fortress.
I must get his belongings ashore.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that on certain news now arrived, concerning the mere total destruction of the Turkish fleet, every man rejoice, some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to whatever sport and revels his disposition leads him, because, besides this good news, it is the celebration of his wedding.
His pleasure should be proclaimed this much.
All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five until the clock rings eleven.
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! 
Iago has orders on what to do; But, nevertheless, with my own eyes I will look to it myself.
Iago is very honest.
Michael, good night.
Tomorrow ,at your earliest, Let me speak with you.
Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to follow, That profit is still to come between me and you.
Good-night.
Welcome, Iago; we must go to the guard.
Not this hour, lieutenant; it is not yet ten of the clock.
Our general put us early like this for the love of his Desdemona, whom we won’t blame.
He hasn’t yet spent the wedding night with her; and she is joy for the gods.
She's a very exquisite lady.
And, I'll guarantee that she is full of game.
Indeed, she is a very fresh and delicate creature.
What an eye she has!
I think it looks like an invitation to excitement.
An inviting eye, and still I think it is properly modest.
And when she speaks, isn’t it a call to love?
She is, indeed, perfection.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lieutenant, I have a bottle of wine; and here outside are a number of Cyprus gents that would happily drink a round to the health of black Othello.
I could really wish manners would invent some other kind of entertainment.
O, they are our friends, only one cup.
I'll drink for you.
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily diluted too, and behold, what changes it makes here.
I am unfortunate in the handicap, and dare not tempt my weakness with any more wine.
What, man!
Where are they?
Here at the door; I beg you, call them in.
I'll do it, but it doesn’t like me.
If I can get him to drink only one cup, With the one he’s already drunk tonight, He'll be as full of fighting and insults As my young mistress' dog.
Now, among this flock of drunkards, I am make our Cassio do some action That may offend the isle.
Some wine, ho!
And let me the small drink clink, clink; And let me the small drink clink.
Before God, an excellent song.
I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are very powerful drinkers.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
Why, he drinks your Dane dead drunk easily; he doesn’t even sweat to defeat your German; he makes your Hollander vomit before the next round can be poured.
To the health of our general!
King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches only cost him a dollar; He held them six cents all too expensive, With that he called the calm tailor.
Will you hear it again?
It's true, good lieutenant.
For my own part, no offense to the general, nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.
And so do I too, lieutenant.
Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs.
Forgive us our sins!
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
Excellent well.
and don’t only see his vice; It is a proper contradiction to his virtue, The one is as long as the other.
It ‘s a pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in, because At some odd time of his infirmity, he Will shake this island.
But is he often like this?
He'll watch the clock all night If drink doesn’t rock his cradle.
It would be good To let the general know about it.
Hey, Roderigo!
I pray you, go after the lieutenant.
What’s that noise?
You rogue!
You rascal!
What's the matter, lieutenant?
A rogue teaching me my duty!
I'll beat the rogue into a wicker bottle.
Beat me!
No, good lieutenant; I beg you, sir, stop.
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you over the head.
Come on, come on, you're drunk.
Drunk!
What is the matter here?
Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
Hold, for your lives!
lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--gentlemen,-- Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold!
Why, how now, ho!
What started this?
Have we turned to Turks, and do to ourselves What Heaven has forbidden the Ottoman?
What is the matter, gentlemen?
Honest Iago, looking dead with grieving, Speak, who began this?
How is it, Michael, that you have forgotten yourself?
I beg you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
Worthy Montano, you were inclined to be civil; The world has marked he gravity and stillness of your youth and your name is great In mouths of wisest respect.
What's the matter, That you destroy your reputation like this, And waste your reputation for the name Of a night-brawler?
Answer me.
I don’t know anything That I said or did wrong this night, Unless self-love is sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves is a sin When we are attacked violently.
Now, by heaven, My blood begins to rule my safer sense, And passion, having influenced my better judgment Tries to lead the way.
If I once get angry, And only lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my scolding.
Let me know How this nasty fight began, who started it, And he that is guilty of this offense, Even if he is my twin brother, both born at the same time, He’ll be finished with me.
What!
In a town of war Still waging, the people's hearts brimful of fear, To control private and domestic quarrels, At night, and on the court and guard of safety!
It is monstrous.
Iago, who started it ?
If partially connected or together in office, You deliver more or less than truth, You are no soldier.
I’d rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio; Still, I convince myself, speaking the truth Shall not wrong him.
It’s like this, general.
Montano and myself were talking, and There comes a fellow crying out for help, With Cassio following him with determined sword, To kill him.
He, fast of foot, Outran me; and I returned Because that I heard the clink and fall of swords, And Cassio swearing loudly; which, until tonight, I never saw him do before.
When I came back, For this was brief,--I found them close together, Everyone was fighting, even as again they were When you yourself parted them.
I can’t report more of this matter, But men are men; the best sometimes forget themselves.
Though Cassio did only little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received Some strange insult From him that fled, Which patience could not let him get away with.
I know, Iago, Your honesty and love minimize this matter, Making it easier for Cassio.
Cassio, I love you; But never more be an officer of mine.
Look, my gentle love is awakened!
I'll make you an example.
What's the matter?
All's well now, sweetheart; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, I myself will be your surgeon.
Take him away.
Iago, look carefully about the town, And silence those whom this vile brawl has upset.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Yes, beyond all cures.
By Mary, heaven forbid!
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
O, I have lost my reputation!
I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is beastly.
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.
Reputation is an idle and very false burden, often got without merit and lost without being deserved.
You have lost no reputation at all, unless you believe yourself to be such a loser.
What, man!
There are ways to regain the general again.
You are now only fallen in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even as some one would beat his defenseless dog to scare an imperious lion.
Talk to him again, and he’ll like you again.
I will rather seek to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.
Drunk?
and talk like a parrot?
and squabble?
swagger?
swear?
and pick a fight with my own shadow?
O you invisible spirit of wine, if you don’t have a name to be known by, let’s call you devil!
Who were you following with your sword?
What had he done to you?
I don’t know.
Is it possible?
I remember a lot, but nothing clearly, a quarrel, but not why.
O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!
That we should, with joy, pleasure, partying, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
Why, you’re sober enough now.
How did you get this sober?
Come, you are too moral.
As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not happen, but since it is what it is, fix it for your own good.
I’ll ask him for my job back; he’ll tell me I am a drunkard!
If I had as many mouths as a seven-headed goddess, such an answer would shut them all.
Now I’m a sensible man, soon a fool, and now a beast!
O strange!
Every uncontrolled cup is evil, and the ingredient is a devil.
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it is well used.
Say no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
I have well proven it, sir.
I got drunk!
You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man.
I'll tell you what you shall do.
freely tell her the truth; beg her help to put you in your place again.
She is so free, so kind, so proper, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a sin in her goodness not to do more than she is asked.
Beg her to fix this broken joint between you and her husband, and, I’ll bet against any thing worth naming, this crack in your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
You advise me well.
No, only in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
You are right.
Good-night, lieutenant; I must get going to the guard.
Good night, honest Iago.
And who’s he, then, that says I play the villain?
When this advice I give is free and honest, Calculated to his thinking, and, indeed, the way To win the Moor again?
Because it is very easy To involve the listening Desdemona In any honest pursuit.
She's been made as fruitful As the free elements.
And then for her To win the Moor, if it meant renouncing his own baptism, All seals and symbols of forgiveness, His soul is so chained to her love That she may make, unmake, do whatever she wants, Even as her wishes shall play the god With his weak ability to think.
How am I, then, a villain To advise Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good?
Divinity of hell!
So I will turn her virtue into black tar, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall tangle them all up.
What’s up, Roderigo!
I followed you here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but like the hunted by the hound.
How poor are they who have no patience!
What wound ever healed except bit by bit?
You know we work by wit and not by witchcraft; And wit depends on slow time.
Doesn’t it go well?
By the mass, it is morning; Pleasure and work make the hours seem short.
Go get some sleep; go where you are staying.
Get going, I say; you shall know more later; No, get going.
Gentlemen, play here, I will reward your pains, Something that's brief and say, “Good morning, General.” Hey, fellows, have your instruments been in Naples, that they sound as horrible as like this?
What, sir, how!
Are these, I beg you, wind instruments?
Yes, by Mary, they are, sir.
What “half the story,” sir?
By Mary, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know.
Well, sir, we won’t.
We don’t have any, sir.
Then put your pipes away in your bag, because I'm leaving.
Did you hear, my honest friend?
No, I don’t hear your honest friend; I hear you.
I beg you, keep up your jokes.
There's a poor piece of gold for you.
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife is awake, tell her there's one Cassio begs a little favor of speaking with her.
Will you do this?
Do, my good friend.
Good to see you, Iago.
You have not been to bed then?
Why, no; the day dawned Before we parted.
I have made bold, Iago, To send for your wife.
My request to her Is, that she will manage to get me access To virtuous Desdemona.
I'll send her to you right away, And I'll devise a plan to get the Moor Out of the way, that your conversation and business May be more free.
I humbly thank you for it.
I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest.
The general and his wife are talking about it; And she strongly speaks up for you.
The Moor replies That the man you hurt is very famous in Cyprus And has a great reputation, and that, in pure wisdom, He might not refuse you, but he protests he loves you And needs no other person begging than his own opinion To take the safest public occasion To bring you back again.
Still, I beg you, If you think it’s okay, or that it may be done, Get me a chance to speak briefly With Desdemona alone.
I beg you, come in.
I will hide you where you shall have time To speak your heart freely.
Thank you so much. 
Well, my good lord, I'll do it.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see it?
We'll wait for your lordship. 
Be assured, good Cassio, I will do All I can in your behalf.
O, that's an honest fellow.
Don’t doubt it, Cassio, That I will have my lord and you As friendly again as you were.
Generous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He'll never be anything but your true servant.
Yes, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed on such nice and light diet, Or take itself so out of circumstance, That, with my absence and my place filled, My general will forget my love and service.
My lord shall never rest; I'll watch him calmly, and talk him out of patience; His bed shall seem like a school, his meals a confessional; I'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio's suit.
Therefore be happy, Cassio; Because your lawyer would rather die Than lose your case.
Madam, here comes My lord.
Madam, I'll leave.
Why, stay, And listen to me speak.
Madam, not now.
I am very uncomfortable, Unfit for my own intentions.
Well, have it your way.
Ha!
I don’t like that.
What did you say?
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
Cassio, my lord!
No, sure, I cannot believe That he would steal away so guiltily, Seeing you coming.
I do believe it was he.
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a petitioner here, A man that suffers greatly in your displeasure.
Who is it you mean?
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.
Didn’t he just leave?
Yes, truly, so humbled That he has left part of his grief with me To suffer with him.
Good love, call him back.
Not now, sweet Desdemon; some other time.
But shall it be soon?
The sooner, sweet, for you.
Shall it be tonight at supper?
No, not tonight.
Tomorrow night at dinner then?
I won’t be eating at home; I have to meet the captains at the fortress.
in faith, he's very sorry; And yet his crime, in our common reason, Except that, they say, the wars must make examples Out of their best, is not almost a fault To incur a private punishment.
When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello.
I wonder in my soul What you would ask me to do that I should deny, Or stand so hesitant about.
What!
No, when I have a favor to ask Where I mean to touch your love indeed, It shall be full of confidence and heavy, And fearful to be granted.
Shall I deny you?
No.
farewell, my lord.
Emilia, come.
Be as your thoughts teach you; Whatever you are, I am obedient.
Excellent wretch!
Destruction take my soul, But I do love you!
and when I don’t love you, Chaos comes back.
Did Michael Cassio, when you courted my lady, Know about your love?
He did, from first to last.
Why do you ask?
Only to satisfy my thought, No further harm.
What bout your thought, Iago?
I didn’t think he had been acquainted with her.
O, yes; and went between us very often.
Indeed!
Indeed!
Yes, indeed.
Do you see anything in that?
Isn’t he honest?
Honest, my lord!
Honest!
Yes, honest.
My lord, for all I know.
What do you think?
Think, my lord!
Think, my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me, As if there were some monster in his thoughts Too hideous to be shown.
What didn’t you like?
If you do love me, Tell me what you were thinking.
My lord, you know I love you.
I think you do; And, because I know you are full of love and honesty And weigh your words carefully before saying them, These stops of yours frighten me even more, Because such things in a false, disloyal rogue Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just They're hidden delays, working from the heart, That passion cannot control.
For Michael Cassio, I would swear I think that he is honest.
I think so too.
Men should be what they seem; Or those that are not, I wish wouldn’t seem so!
Certainly, men should be what they seem.
Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
Speak my thoughts?
Why, what if they are vile and false, Where's that palace that foul things sometimes intrude?
Who has a breast so pure That some unclean thoughts Keep court records and legal holidays, and sit in session With lawful deliberations?
You conspire against your friend, Iago, If you only think him wronged and won’t let him be Anything but a stranger to your thoughts.
I do beg you, Although I am, perhaps, vicious in my guess, As I confess it is a bad habit of mine To look deeply into wrongs, and to find faults that aren’t By my jealousy, that your wisdom still would take no Notice from one that so imperfectly imagines things, Or create a problem for yourself Out of his scattered and unsure observations.
It’s not good for your peace or your wellbeing, Or for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom To let you know my thoughts.
What do you mean?
By heaven, I'll know you’re thinking.
You cannot, unless my heart were in your hand, And that won’t happen while it is in my custody.
Ha!
That deceived man lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, doesn’t love who wronged him; But O, what damned stories he tells about Who loves, but doubts, suspects, but strongly loves!
O misery!
Why, why is this?
Do you think I'd make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions?
Trade me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such puffed up and blown suspicions, Matching your suggestion.
It won’t make me jealous, To say my wife is beautiful, cooks well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well; Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
And I won’t draw from my own weak merits The smallest fear or doubt of her turning against me, Because she had eyes and chose me.
No, Iago, I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, I’ll need proof; And on the proof, there is no more but this, To hell with love or jealousy at once!
I’m glad to hear it; because now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With a more open spirit.
Therefore, as I am supposed to, Receive it from me.
I don’t speak yet of proof.
Look at your wife; observe her well with Cassio; Wear your eye like this, not jealous or secure.
I know our country’s disposition well; In Venice they let heaven see the pranks They wouldn’t dare show their husbands; their best conscience Isn’t to leave it unfinished, but to keep it unknown.
You say so?
She deceived her father by marrying you; And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most.
And so she did.
I am bound to you forever.
I see this has dashed your spirits a little.
Not a jot, not a jot.
Trust me, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider that what I have spoken Comes from my love; but I see you're upset.
I beg you not to push my speech To grosser issues or to reach beyond Mere suspicion.
I will not.
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile things That my thoughts are not aimed at.
No, not too upset.
I can only think that Desdemona's honest.
Long live she so!
and long live you to think so!
But pardon me.
I don’t have the position To speak knowingly of her; although I may fear, Her will, rebelling against her better judgment, May decide to match you with her countrymen, And happily repent her ways.
Leave me, Iago.
My lord, I’m leaving.
Why did I get married?
This honest creature undoubtedly Sees and knows more, much more, than he reveals.
In the meantime, Please think I am too occupied with my fears, As there are strong reasons to fear I am, And consider her innocent, I beg your honor.
Don’t be afraid of what I think.
Once more, I’m leaving.
This fellow's exceedingly honesty, And knows all qualities, with an educated spirit, Of human dealings.
If I prove her unfaithful, Although that her leashes were my dear heartstrings, I'd suddenly go away, and let her follow the wind To plunder fortune.
O curses on marriage, That we can call these delicate creatures ours, And not control their appetites!
I had rather be a toad, And live on the air of a dungeon, Than keep a piece of the thing I love For others' uses.
Still, it is the plague of great men, They have fewer choices than common men; It is an unshakeable destiny, like death.
I'll not believe it.
How are you, my dear Othello!
Your dinner and the generous islanders You invited, wait for your presence.
I am to blame.
Why do you speak so softly?
Are you unwell?
I have a pain on my forehead here.
Come, I'll go in with you.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
I'll have the embroidery taken out, And give it Iago.
What he will do with it heaven knows, I don’t; I only give it to him to please him.
Don’t scold; I have something for you.
A thing for me!
It is a common thing… Ha!
To have a foolish wife.
O, is that all?
What will you give me now For that same handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief!
Why, the one that the Moor first gave to Desdemona; The one that you asked me so often to steal.
Have you stolen it from her?
Look, here it is.
A good wench; give it to me.
What will you do with it, that you have been so eager For me to steal it?
Why, what's that to you?
If it’s not for an important purpose, Give it back to me again.
Poor lady, she'll run mad When she misses it.
Mind your own business ; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
I will put this napkin in Cassio's room, And let him find it.
Not poppy, nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy drugs of the world, Shall ever bring you that sweet sleep Which you had yesterday.
Why, how are you, general!
No more of that.
Go away!
Be gone!
What, my lord!
What sense did I have of her stolen hours of lust?
I am sorry to hear this.
I would’ve been happy if the entire camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, As long as I didn’t know about it.
O, now, forever Farewell to the peaceful mind!
Farewell happiness!
Farewell to the plumed forces and the big wars That make ambition a virtue!
O, farewell, Farewell the neighing horse and the shrill trumpet, The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all goodness, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal device, whose rude throats Pretend to be the immortal Jove's dread clamors, Farewell!
Othello's occupation's gone!
Is it possible, my lord?
Villain, be sure you prove my love a whore; Be sure of it.
Give me the proof I can see; Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, You would’ve been better born a dog Than answer my aroused anger!
Has it come to this?
Make me see it ; or at the least prove it so That the accusation has no hinges or loops To hang a doubt on, or woe on your life!
O grace!
O heaven defend me!
Are you a man?
Have you got a soul or sense?
God be with you; take my job.
O wretched fool, That lives to make your honesty a vice!
O monstrous world!
Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this lesson; and from this point forward, I'll love no friend, since love breeds such contempt.
I should be wise, because honesty's a fool, And loses what it works for.
By the world, I think my wife is honest, and think she is not; I think that you are just, and think you are not.
I'll have some proof.
Her name, that was as fresh As Diana's face, is now as grimy and black As my own face.
If there are ropes or knives, Poison or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it.
I wish I were satisfied!
You would be satisfied?
Would?
No, I will.
And may.
But how?
How satisfied, my lord?
Death and damnation!
O!
It’s a lengthy problem, I think, To bring them to that event.
Damn them then, If ever mortal eyes see them in any bed Other than their own!
What then?
How then?
What shall I say?
Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible that you should see this If they were as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salty as wolves in a pride, and fools as disgusting As ignorance made drunk.
But still, I say, If suggestion and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth, Will give you satisfaction, you may have it.
Give me a living reason why she's unfaithful.
I don’t like the job; But, since I am entered already so far into this cause, Encouraged to it by foolish honesty and love, I will go on.
I slept with Cassio lately, And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.
No, this was only his dream.
And this may help to support other proofs That look questionable.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
Tell me but this, Haven’t you sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
I gave her such a one; it was my first gift.
Now I see it is true.
Arise, black vengeance, from your hollow hell!
Yield up, O love, your crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate!
Swell, bosom, with your fury, Because it is from lavender’s tongues!
Yet calm down.
O, blood, Iago, blood!
Patience, I say; your mind may perhaps change.
Let him command, And it shall be penance for me to obey, Whatever the bloody business is.
Damn her, lewd cat!
O, damn her!
Come, go aside with me; I will leave so I can Equip me with some swift means of death For the beautiful devil.
Now you are my lieutenant.
I am your own forever. 
Do you know, servant, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
Why, man?
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing him.
To tell you where he lives is to tell you where I lie.
Can anything be made out of this?
I don’t know where he lives; and for me to make up a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there is to lie in my own throat.
Can you ask about him and be satisfied by the reports?
I will preach to the world for him; that is, make questions and answer them.
Seek him, bid him come here.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
To do this is within the scope of man's wit, and therefore, I will attempt to do it.
Where should I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
I don’t know, madam.
Believe me, I would rather have lost my purse Full of money, and, except that my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such lowness As jealous creatures are, it would be enough To put him to ill thinking.
Isn’t he jealous?
Who, he?
I think the sun where he was born Took all such humors out of him.
Look, here he comes.
I will not leave him now until Cassio Is called to him.
How is it with you, my lord?
Well, my good lady.
O, hardness to lie!
How are you, Desdemona?
Well, my good lord.
Give me your hand.
This hand is moist, my lady.
This hand of yours requires A vacation from liberty, fasting, and prayer, Much punishment, holy exercise, Because here's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels.
It is a good hand, An open one.
You may, indeed, say so, Because it was that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of old gave hands, But our new code of behavior is hands, not hearts.
I cannot speak about this.
Come now, your promise.
What promise, dear?
I have sent to bid Cassio to come and speak with you.
I have salty and sorry tears that bother me; Lend me your handkerchief.
Here, my lord.
The one I gave you.
I don’t have it with me.
No?
No, faith, my lord.
That is a mistake.
An Egyptian Gave that handkerchief to my mother; She cast charms and could almost read The thoughts of people.
She told her, that, while she kept It, it would make her sweet and soften my father Entirely to her love; but if she lost it Or made a gift of it, my father's eye Should see her as hateful, and his spirits should hunt After new loves.
My mother, dying, gave it to me, And asked me, when my fate would have me marry, To give it to my wife.
Is it possible?
Indeed!
Is it true?
Very true; therefore look well for it.
Then I wish to God that I had never seen it!
Ha!
Why?
Why do you speak so haltingly and angrily?
Is it lost?
Is it gone?
Speak, is it missing?
Heaven bless us!
What do you say?
It is not lost; but what if it were?
How?
I say, it is not lost.
Go get it, let me see it.
Why, so I can, sir, but I won’t now.
This is a trick to distract me from my request.
I beg you, let Cassio be welcomed again.
Come, come; You'll never meet a more capable man.
The handkerchief!
A man that all his life Has founded his good fortunes on your love, Shared dangers with you, The handkerchief!
In truth, you are to blame.
Go away!
This man isn’t jealous?
I never saw this before.
Surely there's some magic in this handkerchief; I am very unhappy at the loss of it.
Go and beg her.
Hello, good Cassio!
what's the news with you?
I would not be delayed.
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My pleading is out of tune right now; My lord is not my lord; and I wouldn’t know him If he were he in favor as changed in disposition.
So every holy spirit help me, As I have spoken all my best for you, And stood shocked at his displeasure Over my free speech!
You must be patient a while.
What I can do, I will; and I will do as much more Than I dare do for myself.
Let that satisfy you.
Is my lord angry?
He went just left, And certainly in a strange state of upset.
Can he be angry?
Something of the moment, then.
I beg you, do so.
Surely it’s some matter of state, Either from Venice or some minor problem Shown to him here in Cyprus, That has muddied his clear spirit, and in such cases Men's natures fight with inferior things, Although their object is great ones.
It’s even so true That we let our finger ache and it infects Our other healthful members, even to the point Of pain.
Scold me a lot, Emilia, I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, Charging his unkindness with a crime of my soul; But now I find I had falsely testified, And he's falsely accused.
Pray heaven it is state matters, as you think, And no plot or no jealous reason Concerning you.
Alas the day, I never gave him reason!
But jealous souls will not be answered that way; They are not ever jealous for a reason, But jealous because they are jealous.
it is a monster Fathered by itself, born of itself.
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
Lady, amen.
I’ll go find him.
Cassio, walk around here.
If I do find him fit, I'll ask for your favor, And try to get it done the best way I can.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Save you, friend Cassio!
What are doing away from home?
How are you, my very beautiful Bianca?
Actually, sweet love, I was just coming to your house.
Seven days and nights?
One hundred sixty-eight hours?
and lovers' absent hours Being more tedious than the clock one hundred sixty times?
O weary calculations!
O Cassio, where did you get this?
This is some gift from a newer girlfriend.
Well, well.
Come one, woman!
Throw your vile guesses into the devil's teeth, From where you got them.
You are jealous now That this is from some mistress, some gift.
Why, whose is it?
I don’t know either.
I found it in my bedroom.
I really like the work.
Leave you!
Why?
I’m waiting here for the general, And I don’t think it would help, and it’s not my wish, To have him see me talking with a woman.
Why, I beg you?
Not that I don’t love you.
But it’s that you don’t love me.
I beg you, walk with me on the way a little; And say if I shall see you later tonight.
That’s very good; I must be patient. 
Will you think so?
Think so, Iago?
What, To kiss in private?
An unauthorized kiss.
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
Why, then, it is hers, my lord, and being hers, She may, I think, give it to any man.
Yes, what of that?
That's not so good now.
What, If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
He has, my lord; but be well assured, No more than he'll deny.
What has he said?
Faith, that he did, I don’t know what he did.
What?
what?
With her, on her, whatever you want to think.
that's sickening.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some reason.
It is not words that shake me like this.
Rubbish!
Noses, ears, and lips.
Is it possible?
O devil!
Work on, My medicine, work!
Believing fools are caught like this; And many worthy and chaste dames just like this, All innocent, meet punishment.
What, ho!
my lord!
my lord, I say!
Othello!
How are you, Cassio!
What's the matter?
Rub him around the temples.
Step aside and hide yourself a little while, He will recover right away.
When he is gone, I would like to speak with you urgently.
How is it, general?
Haven’t hurt your head?
Do you make fun of me?
I make fun of you!
No, by heaven.
I wish you would bear your luck like a man!
An adulterer's a monster and a beast.
There's many a beast, then, in a crowded city, And many a civil monster.
Did he confess it?
Good sir, be a man; Do you think every bearded fellow that wears a harness May be driven by you?
There's millions now alive That nightly lie in those adulterous beds which they dare To swear is the first time.
Your case is better.
O, it is the spite of hell, the fiend's high mockery, To kiss a whore on a safe couch, And to suppose her to be chaste!
No, let me know; And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
O, you are wise; that is certain.
Stand you aside a while; Restrict yourself only in patient way.
While you were being overwhelmed here by your grief, A passion very unsuitable to such a man, Cassio came here.
I sent him away, And gave him a good excuse for your fit; I told him to come back soon and speak here with me; Which he promised to do.
Only hide yourself, And mark the sneers, the taunts, and outstanding scorns, That dwell in every region of his face, Because I will make him tell the story as if it were new, About where, how, how often, how long ago, and when He has had, and is again to have, sex with your wife.
By Mary, have patience; Or I shall say you are totally in a temper, And not a man.
Do you hear me, Iago?
There’s nothing wrong with that, But still be patient in all.
Will you leave and hide?
Now I will question Cassio about Bianca, A housewife that, by selling her desires, Buys herself bread and clothes.
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as it is the whore's disease To trick many and be tricked by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From excessive laughter.
Here he comes.
As he smiles, Othello shall go crazy; And his ignorant jealousy must interpret Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and happy behavior All wrong.
How are you now, lieutenant?
The worse that you give me the additional information Whose lack of information even kills me.
Persist with Desdemona well, and you are sure of it.
Now, if this promise was in Bianca's power, How quickly you would you succeed!
Alas, poor wretch!
Look, how he laughs already!
I never knew a woman could love man so.
Alas, poor rogue!
I think, in faith, she loves me.
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
Do you hear me, Cassio?
Now he urges him To tell it again.
Do it, it’s well said, well said.
Ha, ha, ha!
Do you win, Roman?
Do you win?
Me marry her!
What?
A customer!
I beg you, have some charity for my wit; don’t think it is so unwholesome.
ha, ha, ha!
So, so, so, so.
They laugh that win.
Faith, the rumor goes that you shall marry her.
I beg you, tell the truth.
I am a very villain if I don’t.
Have you played me?
Well.
This is the monkey's own rumor.
She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out because of my promise.
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps on me; so hales and pulls me.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now he tells how she brought him to my bedroom.
O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
Well, I must leave her company.
Before me!
Look, here she comes.
It’s another such polecat!
By Mary, a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you just gave me?
I was a fine fool to take it.
I must take out the embroidery?
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your bedroom and not know who left it there!
This is some cat's gift, and I must take out the work?
There, give it to your whore.
Wherever you had it, I won’t take out any embroidery.
Come now, my sweet Bianca!
Come now!
Come now!
By heaven, that’s my handkerchief!
If you'll come to supper tonight, you may; if you will not, come when you are next ready to.
After her, after her.
Faith, I must, or else she'll raise a ruckus in the street.
Will you have dinner there?
Faith, I intend to.
Well, I maybe I’ll see you; because I would very gladly speak with you.
I beg you, come; will you?
OK, say no more.
How shall I murder him, Iago?
Did you see how he laughed at his sin?
O Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?
Was that mine?
Yours, I swear.
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman, your wife!
She gave it him, and he has given it his whore.
I would take nine years to kill him.
A fine woman!
A beautiful woman!
A sweet woman!
No, you must forget that.
Yes, let her rot, and die, and be damned tonight; because she shall not live.
No, my heart is turned to stone; I hit it, and it hurts my hand.
O, the world has not a sweeter creature.
She might lie by an emperor's side and order him to work.
No, that's not your way.
Hang her!
I only say what she is.
O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!
Of so high and full intelligence and imagination!
She's the worse for all this.
O, a thousand, a thousand times.
and then, of so gentle a disposition!
Yes, too gentle.
No, that's certain.
but yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
If you’re so fond of her sin, give her permission to offend; because, if it doesn’t affect you, it affects nobody.
I will chop her into pieces.
Unfaithful to me!
O, it is evil in her.
With my officer!
That's even more evil.
Get me some poison, Iago; this night.
I'll not argue with her, should her body and beauty change my mind again.
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
You shall hear more by midnight.
Excellent good.
A trumpet within.
What trumpet is that one?
Something from Venice, surely.
It is Lodovico Come from the duke.
And, see, your wife is with him.
God save you, worthy general!
With all my heart, sir.
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
I kiss the instrument of their desires.
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
I am very glad to see you, Signior; Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you.
How does Lieutenant Cassio?
He lives, sir.
Cousin, there's an angry break up that’s fallen between him and my lord, but you shall make all well.
Are you sure of that?
My lord?
Is there division between my lord and Cassio?
A very unhappy one.
I would do a lot To reconcile them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
Fire and brimstone!
My lord?
Are you wise?
What, is he angry?
May be the letter upset him; Because, I think, they command him to come home, Making Cassio governor in his place.
Trust me, I am glad about it.
Indeed!
My lord?
I am glad to see you angry.
I have not deserved this.
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Although I could swear I saw it.
O devil, devil!
If the earth could be flooded with woman's tears, Each drop she lets fall would prove to be a crocodile.
Out of my sight!
I will not stay to offend you.
Mistress!
My lord?
What do you want with her, sir?
Who, I, my lord?
Proceed with your tears.
I am commanded home.
Go away; I'll send for you soon.
Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice.
Away, get going!
Cassio shall take my place.
And, sir, tonight, I beg you that we may dine together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
Goats and monkeys!
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Said had it all?
Is this the nature That passion could not shake?
Whose solid virtue Could be neither grazed nor pierced by The shot of accident or dart of fate?
He is very changed.
Is he sane?
He’s not sick in the brain?
He's what he is.
What, strike his wife!
Faith, that was not good; still I wish I knew if That stroke would prove to be the worst!
Is it his habit?
Or did the letters work on his blood, And newly create this fault?
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to discuss What I have seen and known.
I am sorry that I was wrong about him. 
You have seen nothing, then?
Not ever heard, or ever suspected.
Yes, you have seen Cassio and her together.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that was exchanged between them.
What, did they never whisper?
Never, my lord.
Nor send you out of the way?
Never.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, or anything?
Never, my lord.
That's strange.
I dare, my lord, to bet that she is honest, Burn me at the stake.
If any wretch has put this in your head, Let heaven repay them with the serpent's curse!
Because if she is not honest, chaste, and true, There's no man happy; the purest of their wives Is wicked as the leis about them.
She says enough; yet she's a simple rabbit That cannot say as much.
My lord, what is your will?
Please, dear, come here.
What is your pleasure?
Let me see your eyes; Look into my face.
What horrible desire is this?
On my knees, what does your speech mean?
I understand a fury in your words, But not the words.
Why, what are you?
Your wife, my lord; Your true and loyal wife.
Come, swear it, damn yourself; Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves Should fear to seize you.
Therefore be double-damned, Swear you are honest.
Heaven does truly know it.
Heaven truly knows that you are as false as hell.
To whom, my lord?
With whom?
How am I false?
O Desdemona!
Away!
Away!
Away!
Alas the heavy day!
Why do you cry?
Am I the motive for these tears, my lord?
If you maybe suspect my father is An instrument of this calling you back, Don’t lay your blame on me.
If you have lost him, Why, I have lost him too.
Or keep it as a jug to hold dirty toads To knot and give birth in!
Turn your face there, Patience, you young and rose-lipped archangel, Yes, there, look as grim as hell!
I hope my noble lord believes I am faithful.
O, yes; as summer flies are in the swamps, That move quickly even with blowing.
O you weed, Who are so lovely beautiful, and smell so sweet, That the sense aches at you, I wish you had never been born!
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
Was this beautiful paper, this very excellent book, Made to write “whore” on?
What sin committed!
Committed!
O you public commoner!
I should make very fires of my cheeks Burn modesty into ashes, If I only spoke your deeds.
What committed!
Heaven thumbs its nose at it, and the moon winks; The obscene wind that kisses all it meets Is quiet within the hollow tunnels of earth, And will not hear it.
What committed!
Impudent prostitute!
By heaven, you do me wrong.
Aren’t you a prostitute?
No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this body for my lord From any other evil unlawful touch Is not to be a prostitute, I am none.
What, not a whore?
No, as I shall be saved.
Is it possible?
O, heaven forgive us!
You, mistress, That have the office next to Saint Peter, And keep the gate of hell!
You, you, yes, you!
Alas, what does this gentleman mean?
How are you, madam?
How are you, my good lady?
Faith, half asleep.
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
With who?
Why, with my lord, madam.
Who is your lord?
He that is yours, sweet lady.
I have none.
Don’t talk to me, Emilia; I cannot weep, and I don’t have any answers, Except what should go by water.
I beg you, tonight Lay my wedding sheets on my bed, remember?
And I’ll call your husband here.
Here's a change indeed!
It’s right I should be used this way, very right.
How have I behaved, that he might put The smallest opinion on my least misconduct?
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is it with you?
I cannot tell.
What's the matter, lady?
Alas, Iago, my lord has accused her of being a prostitute, Thrown such angry and horrible words at her, As true hearts cannot bear.
Am I that name, Iago?
What name, beautiful lady?
Such as she says my lord said I was.
Why did he do it?
I don’t know; I am sure I am no one like that.
Don’t weep, don’t weep.
alas the day!
She has abandoned so many noble matches, Her father, and her country, and her friends, To be called whore?
Wouldn’t it make one weep?
It is my wretched luck.
How did this trick come on him?
No, only heaven knows.
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some scheming, lying slave, to get some job, Hasn’t made up this slander, or else, I'll be hanged.
Damn, there is no such man; it is impossible.
If there is a man like that, heaven pardon him!
A noose pardon him!
And hell chew on his bones!
Why should he call her whore?
who keeps her company?
What place?
what time?
what form?
what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some very villainous rogue, Some base notorious rogue, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that you would expose such companions, And put a whip in every honest hand To whip the rascals naked throughout the world, Even from the east to the west!
Speak behind the door.
O, damn on them!
He was some such squire That turned your wit inside out, And made you to suspect me of sleeping with the Moor.
You are a fool; be quiet.
Alas, Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; because, by this light of heaven, I don’t know how I lost him.
Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may kill my life, But never taint my love.
If it were any other… It’s only that, I guarantee it.
Listen how these instruments summon us to supper!
What now, Roderigo!
I don’t believe that you deal justly with me.
On the contrary.
Every day you get me out of the way with some plan, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keep from me all convenience than supplies me with the least advantage of hope.
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
I’ve heard too much already, because your words and actions don’t agree with each other.
You accuse me most unjustly.
With nothing but truth.
I have wasted myself out of my money.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a nun.
Well; OK; very well.
Very well!
OK!
I cannot “OK,” man and it is not very well.
No, I say it is very contemptible, and begin to find myself fooled by it.
Very well.
I tell you it is not very well.
You have said so.
Yes, and said nothing except that which I have every intention of doing.
Why, now I see there's spirit in you; and even from this instant, you build a better opinion of yourself than ever before.
Give me your hand, Roderigo.
You have taken a very just exception against me; but still, I protest, I have dealt very directly concerning your affair.
It doesn’t seem so.
I grant indeed it hasn’t seemed so, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and can be done?
Sir, there is special commission come from Venice to put Cassio in Othello's place.
Is that true?
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
O, no; He goes into Mauritania, and takes the beautiful Desdemona away with him, unless his living here can be delayed by some accident which no one can be so determined about removing of Cassio.
How do you mean removing of him?
Why, by making him incapable of Othello's place; knocking his brains out.
And you would have me do that?
Yes, if you dare to do yourself a profit and a right.
He eats tonight with a harlot, and I will go there to him.
He doesn’t know yet about his honorable fortune.
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to kill him.
It is now high dinner time, and the night is being wasted.
Let’s go.
I will hear further reason for this.
And you shall be satisfied. 
I do beg you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
O, pardon me; it will do me good to walk.
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
Your honor is very welcome.
Will you walk, sir?
My lord?
I will, my lord.
How goes it now?
He looks gentler than he did.
Dismiss me?
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightgown, and goodbye.
We must not now displease him.
I wish you had never seen him!
So do I.
My love forgives him so, That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns, I beg you, unpin my hair, have grace and favor in them.
I have put on those sheets you asked me to.
Makes no difference.
Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I die before you, I beg you, shroud me In one of those same sheets.
Come, come, how you talk.
My mother had a maid called Barbara; She was in love; and the man she loved went crazy And left her.
She had a song of "willow," It was an old thing but it expressed her fortune, And she died singing it.
I beg you, leave.
Shall I go get your nightgown?
No, unpin my hair.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
A very handsome man.
He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his lower lip.
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, Sing all a green willow; Her hand on her breast, her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow, willow.
It's the wind.
I called my love false love; but what said he then?
My eyes itch; Does that predict tears?
it is neither here nor there.
I have heard it said so.
O, these men, these men!
Do you in conscience think, tell me, Emilia, That there are women who abuse their husbands In such a disgusting way?
There are some such, no doubt.
Would you do such a deed for all the world?
Why, wouldn’t you?
No, by this heavenly light!
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do it as well in the dark.
Would you do such a deed for all the world?
The world's a huge thing; it is a great price to pay For a small sin.
In truth, I think you wouldn’t.
In truth, I think I should; and undo it when I had done.
By Mary, I wouldn’t do such a thing for a gold ring, or for measures of soft cotton, or for gowns, petticoats, or caps, or any little show; but, for the whole world -why, who wouldn’t unfaithful to her husband to make him a king?
I would risk purgatory for it.
Curse me, if I would do such a wrong thing for the whole world.
Why, the wrong is but a wrong in the world; and having the world for your work, it is a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
I don’t think there is any such woman.
Yes, a dozen; and as many to profit as would store the world they played for.
What is it that they do when they exchange us for others?
Is it sport?
I think it does.
Is it frailty makes mistakes like this?
It’s so too.
And haven’t we got affections, desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Good-night, good-night.
heaven me send such usage, Not to pick bad from bad, but to change my ways by bad! 
Quickly, quickly; fear nothing; I'll be at your elbow.
It makes us or it ruins us; think on that, And make your resolution very firm.
Be near at hand; I mess it up.
Go forth, my sword; he dies.
I have rubbed this young pimple almost to the purpose, And he grows angry.
Now, whether or not he kills Cassio, Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, I gain in every way.
Live, Roderigo, He calls me to give back all Of gold and jewels that I robbed from him, As gifts to Desdemona; It can’t happen.
If Cassio lives, He has a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor May disclose me to him; I stand there in great danger; No, he must die.
I know his walk; it is he.
Villain, you die!
O, I am slain!
I am maimed forever.
Help, ho!
murder!
murder!
O, villain that I am!
It is even so.
O, help, ho!
light!
a surgeon!
It is he.
O brave Iago, honest and just, That have such noble sense of your friend's wrong!
Prostitute, I’m coming!
Those charms, your eyes, are erased from my heart; Your bed, lust-stained, shall be spotted with lust's blood.
What, ho!
no guard?
no safety?
murder!
murder!
It is some misfortune; the cry is very sorrowful.
O, help!
Listen!
O wretched villain!
Nobody comes?
Then I shall bleed to death.
Listen!
Here's someone comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
Who's there?
Didn’t you hear a cry?
Here, here!
For heaven's sake, help me!
What's the matter?
This is Othello's ensign, as I take it.
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
Who are you here that cry so grievously?
Iago?
O, I am attacked, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
O me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?
I think that one of them is still around here, And cannot make a getaway.
O treacherous villains!
Who are you there?
Come in and give some help.
O, help me here!
That's one of them.
O murderous slave!
O villain!
O damned Iago!
O inhuman dog!
Kill men in the dark!
Where are these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town!
Ho!
murder!
murder!
What are you?
are you of good or evil?
As you shall prove us to be, praise us.
Signior Lodovico?
He, sir.
I be your mercy.
Here's Cassio, hurt by villains.
Cassio!
How is it, brother?
My leg is cut in two.
By Mary, heaven forbid!
What is the matter, ho?
Who is it that cried?
Who is it that cried!
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
O notable prostitute!
Cassio, do you any idea Who they are that have mangled you like this?
No.
Lend me a garter.
So.
O, for a chair, To carry him easily from here!
Alas, he faints!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Gentlemen all, I suspect this trash To be a party to this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio.
Come, come; Lend me a light.
Do we know this face or not?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo?
No.
Yes, surely; O heaven!
Roderigo.
What, of Venice?
Even he, sir.
did you know him?
Know him!
Yes.
Signior Gratiano?
I beg your gentle pardon; These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, That so neglected you.
O, a chair, a chair!
Roderigo!
He, he, it is he.
Some good men carry him carefully from here; I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
For you, mistress, save you your labor.
None in the world; I don’t know the man.
What, do you look pale?
O, carry him out of the air.
Stay you, good gentlemen.
Do you Look pale, mistress?
Do you see the ghastliness of her eye?
No, if you stare, we shall hear more soon.
Watch her well; I beg you, look after her.
Do you see, gentlemen?
No, guiltiness will speak Even if tongues are out of use.
Alas, what's the matter?
What's the matter, husband?
Alas, good gentleman!
Alas, good Cassio!
This is the fruit of whoring.
I beg you, Emilia, Go find out about Cassio, where he had dinner tonight.
What, you shake at that?
He dined at my house; but I don’t shake because of that.
O, did he?
I charge you, go with me.
Damn, damn you, prostitute!
I am no prostitute, but have life as honest As you that abuse me like this.
As I!
damn!
damn you!
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio bandaged.
Come, mistress, you must tell us another tale.
Emilia, run to the fortress, And tell my lord and lady what has happened.
Will you go ahead?
Aside.
This is the night That either makes me or breaks me. 
It is the cause.
Still I won’t shed her blood; Or scar that skin of hers whiter than snow, And as smooth as the marble that makes monuments.
Yet she must die, or else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
O, balmy breath, that almost persuades Justice to break her sword!
One more, one more; Be like this when you are dead, and I will kill you, And love you after.
One more, and this is the last; So sweet was never so fatal.
She awakes.
Who's there?
Othello?
Yes, Desdemona.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?
Yes, my lord.
If you can think of any crime Not yet confessed to heaven and grace, Do it right away.
Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?
I would not kill your soul.
You talk about killing?
Yes, I do.
Then heaven Have mercy on me!
Amen, with all my heart!
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
Hum!
And yet I fear you; because you are deadly When your eyes roll so.
Why I should fear, I don’t know, Since I don’t know guiltiness, but yet I feel I fear.
Think on your sins.
They are loves I bear to you.
Yes, and for that you die.
That death is unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why do you chew your nether lip so?
Peace, and be quiet!
I will do so.
What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave you, You gave to Cassio.
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.
Sweet soul, take care, Take care of perjury; you are on your death-bed.
Yes, but not to die yet.
You are to die.
Then, Lord have mercy on me!
I say, amen.
And you have mercy too!
I never Offended you in my life; never loved Cassio Except with such general lawfulness of heaven As I might love.
I never gave him gifts.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in his hand.
O lying woman!
He found it then; I never gave it to him.
He has confessed.
What, my lord?
That he has used you.
How?
Unlawfully?
Yes.
He will not say so.
No, his mouth is stopped; Honest Iago has taken orders for it.
O, my fear interprets!
What, is he dead?
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge Had stomach for them all.
Alas, he is betrayed, and I have no hope!
Out, prostitute!
You weep for him to my face?
O, banish me, my lord, but don’t kill me!
Down, prostitute!
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
No, if you strive… But half an hour!
Being done, there is no pause.
But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
My lord, my lord!
what, ho!
my lord, my lord!
What noise is this?
Not dead?
Not yet quite dead?
I who is cruel am yet merciful; I would not have you linger in your pain.
So, so.
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
Who's there?
O, my good lord, I would speak with you!
By and by.
She's dead.
Ha!
no more moving?
As still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
Were it good?
I think she moves again.
No.
What's best to do?
If she comes in, she'll surely speak to my wife.
My wife!
my wife!
what wife?
I have no wife.
O, unbelievable!
O heavy hour!
I think there should now be a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, and that the frightened globe Should yawn at changes.
I beg you To let me speak with you, O, my good lord!
I had forgotten about you.
O, come in, Emilia.
Softly, by and by.
Let me draw the curtains.
Where are you?
What's the matter with you now?
O, my good lord, there's foul murders done over there!
What, now?
Just now, my lord.
It is the very mistake of the moon; She comes more nearer earth than she usually does And makes men mad.
Cassio, my lord, has killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo.
Roderigo killed?
And Cassio killed?
No, Cassio is not killed.
Cassio not killed!
Then murder's out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
O, falsely, falsely murdered!
Alas, what cry is that?
That!
what?
Out, and alas!
That was my lady's voice.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!
I die an innocent death.
O, who has done this deed?
Nobody; I myself.
O, farewell!
Why should she be murdered?
Alas, who knows?
You heard her say it herself it wasn’t I.
O, she is more the angel, And you the blacker devil!
She turned to folly, and she was a whore.
You lie about her, and you are a devil.
She was false as water.
You are impatient as fire, to say That she was false.
O, she was heavenly true!
Cassio screwed her; ask your husband otherwise.
O, I was damned beneath all the depths of hell, And I proceeded on just grounds To this extremity.
Your husband knew it all.
My husband!
Your husband.
That she was unfaithful in marriage?
Yes, with Cassio.
No, had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect crystal, I wouldn’t have sold her for it.
My husband!
My husband!
Why do you repeat it, woman?
I said your husband.
O mistress, villainy has made fun with love!
My husband said that she was unfaithful!
He, woman; I say your husband.
Do you understand the word?
My friend, your husband, honest, honest Iago.
If he said so, may his evil soul Rot half a grain a day!
He lies to the heart.
She was too fond of her very filthy bargain.
Ha!
Peace, you’d better stop.
You have not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt.
O fool!
O idiot!
As stupid as dirt!
You have done a deed, I don’t care about your sword; I'll make you famous, Although I lose twenty lives.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
The Moor has killed my mistress!
murder, murder!
What is the matter?
What’s wrong, general!
O, are you here, Iago?
You have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck.
What is the matter?
Speak, because my heart is full.
I told him what I thought; and told no more Than what he himself discovered was right and true.
But did you ever tell him she was unfaithful?
I did.
You told a lie; an stinking, damned lie; On my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.
She unfaithful with Cassio!
Did you say with Cassio?
With Cassio, mistress.
Watch it, control your tongue.
I will not control my tongue; I have to speak.
My mistress lies here murdered in her bed.
O heavens forbid!
And your stories have egged the murder on.
It is a strange truth.
O monstrous act!
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think about it, I think, I smell it ; O villainy!
What, are you crazy?
I order you, go home.
Maybe, Iago, I will never go home.
O!
O!
O!
No, lay down and roar; Because you have killed the sweetest innocent That ever lifted open eyes.
O, she was evil!
I scarcely knew you, uncle; there lies your niece, Whose breath, indeed, these hands have just stopped.
I know this act looks horrible and grim.
Poor Desdemona!
It was a handkerchief, an antique token My father gave my mother.
O heaven!
O heavenly powers!
Come, hold your peace.
It will be out, it will be out.
Me quiet!
Be wise, and go home.
I will not.
Damn!
Your sword on a woman?
O you stupid Moor!
That handkerchief you speak of I found by luck and gave it to my husband; Because, he begged me to steal it Often with a solemn earnestness, More than, indeed, belonged to such a trifle.
Villainous whore!
She give it Cassio!
No, alas, I found it, And I gave it to my husband.
Filth, you lie!
By heaven, I don’t, I don’t, gentlemen.
O murderous simpleton!
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife?
Are there no stones in heaven To serve as thunder?
Precious villain!
The woman falls; surely, he has killed his wife.
Yes, yes.
O, lay me by my mistress' side.
He's gone, but his wife's killed.
He is a notorious villain.
I'll go after that same villain, Because he is a damned slave.
I am not valiant either, But every puny man with a whip gets my sword.
But why should honor outlive honesty?
Let it all go.
What did your song predict, lady?
Listen, can you hear me?
I will play the swan, And die in music.
Sings.
Moor, she was chaste; she loved you, cruel Moor; So my soul goes to heaven, because I tell the truth; So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Uncle, I must come out.
You have no weapon, and must be forced to suffer.
Look in on me then, and speak with me, Or, naked as I am, I will attack you.
What’s the matter?
Behold, I have a weapon; A better one never sustained itself On a soldier's thigh.
I have seen the day That I have made my way through more impediments With this little arm and this good sword Than you could stop twenty times.
But, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate?
It is not so now.
Don’t be afraid although you see me armed, Here is my journey's end, here is my bottom And very sea-mark of my last ship.
Do you go back dismayed?
It is a lost fear; Man can only rush against Othello's breast, And he retires.
Where should Othello go?
Now, how do you look now?
O ill-starred wench!
Pale as your smock!
When we shall meet at elegance, This look of yours will hurl my soul from heaven, And devil will scratch at it.
O cursed, cursed slave!
Whip me, you devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds!
Roast me in fires of sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemon!
dead, Desdemon!
dead!
Where is this impatient and very unfortunate man?
Where is that snake?
Bring the villain out.
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If you are a devil, I cannot kill you.
Grab his sword from him.
I bleed, sir, but I am not killed.
I am not sorry either.
I'd have you live; Because, in my thinking, it is happiness to die.
O you Othello, that was once so good, Fallen in the plan of a damned slave, What shall be said to you?
Why, anything; An honorable murderer, if you will; Because nothing I did was in hate, but done all in honor.
This wretch has part confessed his villainy.
Did you and he agree to Cassio's death?
Yes.
Dear general, I never gave you any reason.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I beg you, demand that demi-devil To tell why he has trapped my soul and body like this?
From this time forward, I’ll never speak word.
What, not even to pray?
Torture will open your lips.
Well, you do what’s best.
Sir, you shall understand what has happened, Which, as I think, you don’t know.
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the murdered Roderigo, And here another.
One of them shows that The death of Cassio was to be undertaken By Roderigo.
O villain!
Very heathenish and very gross!
Now here's another unhappy document, Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, That Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; But that, very likely, Iago in the meantime Came in and satisfied him.
O the pernicious wretch!
Cassio, how did you come by that handkerchief That was my wife's?
I found it in my bedroom; And he himself confessed just now That he dropped it there for a special purpose Which would be bent to his desires.
O fool!
fool!
fool!
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him a lot and stop him a long time, It shall be his.
You shall remain a prisoner, Until the nature of your crime is known To the Venetian state.
Come, bring him away.
Pardon me, a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know it.
No more of that.
I beg you, in your letters, When you shall tell about these unlucky deeds, Speak of me as I am; nothing farfetched, And don’t write anything in malice.
Then you must speak Of one that loved not wisely, but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but, being aggravated, Confused in the extreme; of one whose hand, Like the low Judas, threw a pearl away That was richer than all his tribe; of one whose sad eyes, Albeit unused to a crying spell, Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees drop Their medicinal gum.
Write this down; And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and double-crossed the state, I took the circumcised dog by the throat And killed him like this.
O bloody period!
All that's spoken is marred.
I kissed you before I killed you.
No way but this, Killing myself, to die on a kiss.
I was afraid of this, but I thought he had no weapon; He was great of heart.
O Spartan dog, More evil than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
Look on the tragic load on this bed; This is your work.
The object of poison’s sight; Let it be hidden.
Gratiano, keep the house, And seize on the fortunes of the Moor, Because they fall on you.
I myself will board the ship right away and go to the state To relate his heavy act with heavy heart. 
Good!
Let’s go, my good men!
Look lively, look lively, my good men!
Quick, quick!
Take in the top sail.
Listen to the Captain's whistle.
To the storm] Blow your wind until you burst, so long as there’s room enough for us.
Where's the Captain?
Keep the men moving.
Please now, keep below.
Where is the Captain, officer in charge?
Don’t you hear him?
No, good man, be patient.
I’ll be patient when the sea is patient.
Get going!
What do these noisy storms care about the name of king?
Don’t bother us.
Good man, even now, remember whom you have aboard.
No one that I love more than myself.
You are a council member: if you can command these elements to be silent, And make this present storm more peaceful, we won’t need To work the ropes anymore.
I get great comfort from this fellow.
I don’t think he has been marked for drowning: his complexion is perfect for being hanged.
Hold your position, good Fate, for his hanging!
Make the rope of his hanging our rope for the anchor, because the one we have now does us little good!
If he is not born to be hanged, then our present state is pitiful.
Down with the top mast!
Quick!
Lower, lower!
A cry inside] Damn their screaming!
What are you doing here?
Shall we give up and drown?
Do you intend to sink us?
Damn your voice, you loud, cursing, selfish dog!
Then go to work.
Hang, dog, hang!
Bastard, arrogant noisemaker, we’re less afraid to be drowned than you are.
I'll wager against his drowning, even if the ship was no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unsatisfied mistress.
We’re all lost!
Say your prayers; say your prayers!
We’re all lost!
What, must our voices be ignored?
The King and Prince are saying prayers!
Let’s join them, Since our predicament is the same as theirs.
I am out of patience.
He'll still be hanged, Although every drop of water swears against it And open very wide to fill him up.
Mercy on us!”— “We’re breaking up, we’re breaking up!”—”Goodbye, my wife and children!”— “Goodbye, brother!”—”We’re breaking up, we’re breaking up, we’re breaking up!”— Let's all sink with the King.
Let's tell him goodbye.
Right now, I would give a 220,000 yards of sea for an acre of bare ground; a long wasteland, brown brush, anything.
If, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters Into this fury by your magic, stop them.
It seems that the sky would pour down stinking, boiling tar, Except that the sea, mounting to the cloud’s cheek, Puts the fire out.
Poor souls, they perished.
If I had been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea on the earth, before It would have swallowed the good ship and The souls that were her cargo.
No harm done.
I have done nothing except to protect you, Protect you, my dear one, you, my daughter, who Doesn’t know what you are, not knowing Where I come from or that I better Than Prospero, master of a full, poor dwelling, And your not so proud father.
It never entered my mind To know more.
It is time I should tell you more.
Give me your hand, And take my magic cloak from me.—So: Lie there my magic.—Wipe your eyes; have comfort.
The sad spectacle of the wreck, which touched The very virtue of compassion in you, I have ordered so safely with similar use of my magic That there is no soul— No, not so much damage as to one hair Happened to any creature on the vessel Which you heard cry, which you saw sink.
Sit down; Because you must now know more.
You have often Started to tell me who I am, but you stopped, And left me to a useless questioning, Concluding “Wait, not yet.” Now it’s time, The very minute asks you to listen carefully; Obey and listen.
Can you remember A time before we came to this dwelling?
I don’t think you can, because then you weren’t Three years old yet.
Certainly, sir, I can.
How?
It is faded, And rather like a dream than a definite Memory in my mind.
Didn’t I once have Four, or five, women once, that took care of me?
You did, and more, Miranda.
But how is it That this memory lives in your mind?
What else do You see in the old, dark, bottomless pit of time?
If you remember anything before you came here, How you came here, you may remember.
But I don’t remember coming here.
Your mother was a piece of virtue, and She said you were my daughter: and your father Was Duke of Milan and his only heir A princess — born no less.
O, the heavens!
What foul play did we have that we left there?
Or was it a blessing that we did?
Both, both, my girl.
By foul play, as you say, we were lifted from there, But blessedly helped here.
Please, go on.
My brother and your uncle, called Antonio— Please, listen to me,—that a brother should Be so guilty of breaking a trust!—he, whom I loved in All the world, after you, and I let him Manage of my city, since, at that time, It was the first of all the cities, And Prospero the best duke, being considered so In dignity, and for the liberal arts, Without equal: since these two items took up all my time in study, I cast the government on my brother, And I became a stranger to my city, being absorbed And wrapped up in my secret studies.
Your false uncle— Are you listening to me?
Sir, very carefully.
Oh, good sir, I am!
Please, listen to me.
My neglecting worldly responsibilities like that, Dedicating everything to seclusion and the bettering Of my mind with that which, only by being so secluded, Was worth more than all popular opinion, awoke in my False brother an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, made him Lie, a lie as great As my trust was, which had no limit indeed, A confidence without boundaries.
Playing the lord like that, Not only with what my money yielded, But also whatever else my power might get him,—like one Who having lied so often by telling it enough, Made his memory such a sinner that it gave Truth to his own lie,—he believed He was indeed the Duke, making substitution for me, And wearing the outward show of royalty, With all rights and privileges.—Here his ambition growing— Are you listening?
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
To have no separation between this part he played And the man he played it for, he had to become the Absolute Duke of Milan.
For me, poor man—my library Was dukedom large enough: now he believes that I am Incapable of performing my political duties; he makes an alliance,— He was so hungry for power,—with the King of Naples To give Naples annual protection money, pledge allegiance, Surrender his small crown to Naples’ crown, and bend The dukedom, which had never bowed before—alas, poor Milan!— To most dishonorable bowing.
Oh, the heavens!
Listen to the situation and the event; Then tell me if this might be a brother.
I should sin only To think nobly of my grandmother: Good women have had bad sons.
Now the situation.
This King of Naples, being an old enemy Of mine, listens my brother's request, Which was, that he, instead of the promises Of allegiance and I don’t know how much protection money, Should presently drive me and my family Out of the dukedom, and give the fair city of Milan, With all the honors to my brother: which, With a treacherous army recruited, on a midnight Assigned to the purpose, Antonio opened The gates of Milan; and, in the dead of darkness, The ones given the job hurried Me and your crying self from there.
A pity that it should be so!
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it out all over again: it is a moment That makes my eyes cry.
Listen a little bit more, And then I'll bring you to the present situation Which is now here, without which, this story Would be most irrelevant.
Why didn’t they Destroy us then and there?
Good question, girl: My tale invites that question.
There they launched us, To cry to the sea that roared at us, to sigh To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Only did us loving wrong.
what trouble I was to you then!
Oh, you were an angel That saved me!
You smiled, Instilled with strength from heaven, When I have covered the sea with salty tears, Groaning under my load, which raised in me A new strength, to put with Whatever should follow.
How did we come ashore?
By Divine Providence.
We had some food and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,—who, being then appointed Supervisor of this plot,— gave us out of his goodness, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and other necessities, Which have since been very useful: so, of his gentleness, Knowing how I loved my books, he supplied me, With volumes from my own library that I prize more than my dukedom.
I wish I might Only see that man again!
We arrived here on this island: and here I, your schoolmaster, have made you grow more Than other princes can, who have more time For worthless hours, and tutors that are not as careful.
Heavens thank you for it!
And now, please, sir,— Because it is still on my mind,—your reason For raising this storm at sea?
Know this much.
Now, my dear lady, by most strange accident, Generous Luck, has brought my enemies To this shore; and by my knowledge of things to come, I find my highest point depends on A very lucky star, that, if I don’t seek its influence now And overlook it, my fortunes Will sink forever after.
I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel; Come!
I come To answer your best requests; is it to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds; give Ariel and all his quality Your strong requests.
In every detail.
My brave spirit!
Who is so firm, so constant, that this noisy disturbance Would not infect his sanity?
There wasn’t a soul that Only felt a fever of the madness and played Some tricks out of desperation.
All except the sailors Jumped in the foaming ocean and abandoned ship, Then I was all on fire: the King's son, Ferdinand, With hair standing up straight —then like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that jumped, crying “Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.” Why, that's my spirit!
But wasn’t this near the shore?
Close by, my master.
But are they safe, Ariel?
Not even a hair died; Not a spot on their clothing, But fresher than they were before, and, as you ordered me, I have dispersed them in groups around the island.
I have brought the king's son ashore by himself, And I left him cooling off with the air that blows gently In a remote spot of the island, and sitting, His arms sadly folded like this.
Tell me how you have disposed Of the King's ship, the sailors, And all the rest of the fleet?
Except that there's more work.
What time of the day is it?
Past noon.
At least two hours past that.
The time between six and now Must be spent most preciously by us both.
Is there more work?
Since you give me so much trouble, Let me remind you what you have promised, Which is not yet done for me.
How is it now!
Moody?
What is it you demand?
My freedom.
Before the debt is paid?
No more!
Please, Remember I have worked faithfully for you, Told you no lies, made no mistakes, served Without a grudge or grumblings.
You promised To give it to me after a full year.
Do you forget From what a torment I freed you?
No.
You do, and you think it’s a lot to walk the waves Of the ocean, To run on the sharp wind of the north, To do my business under the earth When it is baked with frost.
I don’t, sir.
You lie, malignant thing!
Have you forgotten The foul witch Sycorax, who had grown in to a circle With age and envy?
Have you forgotten her?
No, sir.
You have.
Where was she born?
Speak; tell me.
Sir, in Algeria.
I must recount What you have been once a month, Which you forget.
They would not take her life for one thing she did.
Isn’t this true?
Yes, sir.
This blue-eyed hag was brought here, pregnant, And was left here by sailors.
Then this was an island—except for the son that she had here, A freckled pup, born of a witch—not resembling Any human shape.
Yes, Caliban, her son.
I say he’s a dull thing, that Caliban, Whom now I keep as a servant.
I thank you, master.
If you make any more complaints, I will open an oak And put you inside it until You have howled away twelve more years.
Do so; and after two days, I will set you free.
That's my noble master!
What shall I do?
Go, change into a spirit, And come here invisibly: go, come here with care!
Awake, dear heart, awake!
You have slept well; Awake!
The strangeness of your story Made me very sleepy.
Shake it off.
Come on; We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never Gives us a kind answer.
It is a villain, sir, that I don’t like to look at.
But as it is, We can’t dismiss him: he makes our fire, Fetches in our wood; and serves in jobs That are to our advantage.—What hey!
There's enough wood inside.
When?
Fine apparition!
My lord, it shall is done.
You poisonous slave, fathered by the devil himself Through your wicked mother, come out!
Let a dew as wicked as any my mother brushed From a polluted bog with raven's feather Fall on both of you!
A south-west wind blow on you, And blister you all over!
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, through Sycorax my mother, Which you took from me.
All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, fall on you!
Because I am all of the subjects that you have, Who was first my own king; and here you chain me To this hard rock, while you keep from me The rest of the island.
You most lying slave, Whom beatings may move, not kindness!
I have used you, Filth as you are, with human care, and let you live In my own dwelling, until you tried to rape My daughter.
I wish I had!
You stopped me; I would have populated This island with Calibans.
Disgusting slave, In which any type of goodness won’t take hold, Being capable of every evil!
Offspring of a witch, come here!
Get fuel for us and you had better be quick About answering the other business.
So, slave: get going!
Come to these yellow sands, And then take my hands: Bow courteously when you have and kiss me,— The wild waves are silent,— Dance gracefully here and there; And, sweet spirits, listen to the chorus.
Listen, listen!
Chorus off-stage: Bow, wow!
at different times)] Listen, listen!
Is it in the air or the earth?
It’s stopped;—and surely, it’s for Some god of the island.
No, it begins again.
Sea-spirits ring his death bell every hour: [Chorus (off-stage): Ding-dong.
The little song reminds me of my drowned father.
This is not an act of man, nor any sound Like those on earth:—I hear it now above me.
What is it?
A spirit?
Lord, how it looks about!
I might call him A divine thing; because I have never seen Anything so natural that was so noble.
Aside] It goes just the way, I see, That my soul wants it.—Spirit, fine spirit!
I'll free you Within two days for this.
I’m not a miracle, sir; But certainly a virgin.
My language!
What!
The best?
What would happen to you, if the King of Naples heard you?
An alone thing, as I am now, that is amazed To hear you speak of Naples.
He hears me; And I weep because he does: I myself am Naples, Who saw,—and I haven’t stopped crying,—saw The King, my father wrecked.
How sad, for mercy!
Yes, believe me, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan, And his brave son being two of those lost.
Aside.
Why speaks my father so roughly?
Aside.
Oh!
To FERDINAND] One word more: I order you that you wait on me.
Here you steal The name you don’t own and have put yourself On this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord of it.
No, I swear it as a man.
Follow me.
No; I will resist such treatment until My enemy has more power to fight.
What!
Don’t hang on my clothes.
Sir, have pity; I'll be his guarantee.
Silence!
One word more Shall make me scold you, if not hate you.
Hush!
To many men this is a Caliban, And they are angels to him.
You shall be as free As the mountain winds if you only do Exactly every detail of my command.
Please, peace.
Any comfort he gets is like cold oatmeal.
The visitor won’t abandon him like that.
Sir,— One: speak.
You have taken it more seriously than I meant you to.
Therefore, my lord,— Damn it, what a waste he makes of his words!
Please, spare me.
The old rooster.
The young rooster.
OK. What’s the bet?
A hearty laugh.
It’s a bet!
Though this island seems to be deserted,— Ha, ha, ha!
So, now you're paid.
Unable to be lived on and almost out of reach,— Still— Still— He couldn’t resist it.
It has to be of mild, tender, and delicate climate.
Climate was a delicate mistress.
Yes, and mild, as he has said most knowledgeably.
The air here is very sweet for us.
Or, as it were perfumed by a swamp.
True; except the means to live it.
There's none, or little of that.
How lush and lusty the grass looks!
How green!
The ground indeed is orangey.
With a touch of green in it.
He doesn’t miss much.
No; he only totally misses the truth.
But the special thing about it is,—which is indeed almost beyond belief,— As many verified “special things” are.
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the ocean, have, nevertheless, retained their freshness and sheen, seeming to be just cleaned rather than stained with salt water.
If only one of his pockets could speak, wouldn’t it say he lies?
Yes, or hide the report in the pocket.
I think our garments are now as fresh as they were when we first put them in Africa, at the wedding of the king's fair daughter, Claribel, to the King of Tunis.
It was a sweet wedding, and we were doing so well on our return.
Tunis was never graced before with anything equal to their queen.
Not since widow Dido's time.
Widow!
Like hell she was!
How did she become a widow?
Widow Dido!
Widow Dido,” you said?
You made me study that one; she was from Carthage, not of Tunis.
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Carthage?
Trust me, Carthage.
His word is more miraculous than the magic harp.
He has raised the wall and houses too.
What impossible subject will he make easy next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son as an apple.
And, sowing the seeds of it in the ocean, create more islands.
Yes.
Why, in good time.
To ALONSO.
Sir, we were discussing how our garments now seem as fresh as they were when we were at the wedding of your daughter, who is now Queen, in Tunis.
And the rarest person that ever came there.
Stop, please, widow Dido.
Oh!
Widow Dido; yes, widow Dido.
Isn’t my jacket, sir, as fresh as the first day I wore it?
I mean, in a way.
You cram these words into my ears against The stomach of my sense.
I wish I had never Married my daughter there!
Because, coming from there, My son is lost; and, in my opinion, she is too, Who is so far away from Italy, That I shall never see her again.
No, no; he's gone.
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, Since you wouldn’t bless our Europe with your daughter, But would rather marry her to an African; Where she is, at least, out of your sight, You who has cause to shed tears about it.
Please, peace.
You were kneeled to and otherwise begged By all of us; and the fair soul herself Considered at which option she should take, Between reluctance and obedience.
So is the most difficult loss.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak lacks some gentleness And proper timing; you rub the wound, When you should bring the Band-Aid.
Very well.
And almost like a licensed surgeon.
It is bad weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy.
Very bad.
If I had a plantation of this island, my lord,— Listen, plant it with plants that sting.
Or the antidote for stinging plants or hollyhocks.
And if the king were on it, what would I do?
In the country, I would carry out all things By opposites; because I wouldn’t admit Any kind of traffic; have no one named magistrate; Appeals before a court wouldn’t be recognized; riches, poverty, And slavery, none; treaties, lines of succession, Boundaries, boundary lines of land, farming, vineyards, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupations; all men idle, all: And women too, only innocent and pure; No supreme ruler,— But he would be king on it.
No marrying among his subjects?
None, man: all are idle whores and rogues.
I would govern with perfection like yours, sir, To surpass the golden age.
Save his Majesty!
Long live Gonzalo!
I really do believe your highness; and did it to provide opportunity to these gentlemen, who have similar common sense and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
It was you we laughed at.
Who is nothing to you in this kind of merry joking, so you may continue and still laugh at nothing.
What a hard blow that was!
If it had not fallen dead flat.
You are gentlemen of brave spirit: you would lift the moon out of her orbit if she would continue in it for five weeks without changing.
We would so, and then go swindling.
No, good my lord, don’t be angry.
No, I promise you; I won’t risk my reputation so stupidly.
Will you laugh me asleep, because I am exhausted?
Go to sleep, and listen to us.
I wish my eyes Would shut up my thoughts by closing: I think They want to do so.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you sleep, And watch for your safety.
Thank you.
Amazingly sleepy!
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
It is the nature of the climate.
Why Doesn’t then make our eyelids close?
I don’t find Myself wanting to sleep.
Me either: I’m wide awake.
They all fell asleep together, as if they all agreed; They dropped, as if hit by a thunder-stroke.
Aren’t you listening to me speak?
I do: and surely It is a sleepy language, and you talk In your sleep.
What is it you said?
This is a strange rest, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep.
Noble Sebastian, You let your fortune sleep — die rather: wink While you are waking.
You snore distinctly: There's meaning in your snores.
Well, I am standing water.
I'll teach you how to flow.
Do so: laziness I inherited teaches me to go down, Oh!
If you only knew how you appreciate the purpose While you mock it like this!
How, in stripping it bare, You invest more in it!
Men that flow backward indeed, Most often, run too near to the bottom By their own fear or laziness.
Like this, sir: Although this lord of weak memory, this man Who shall be remembered little When he is buried, here has almost persuaded,— Because he's a spirit of persuasion, only he Professes to persuade,—the King’s son is alive, It is as impossible that he's not drowned As he who sleeps here swims.
I have no hope That he's not drowned.
To have no hope that he is drowned is another way to have such a high hope, That even Ambition can’t see beyond it, But defies belief.
Will you agree with me That Ferdinand is drowned?
He's gone.
Then tell me, Who's the next heir of Naples?
Claribel.
What are you talking about!—How are you saying?
It’s true, my brother's daughter is Queen of Tunis; She also inherits Naples; there is some distance Between the two countries.
There is one that can rule Naples As well as the man who is sleeping, lords that can talk As much and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo: I myself could make Asses of these lords .
O, I wish you were of The same mind as I am!
What a sleep this is For your advancement!
Do you understand me?
I think I do.
And how does your happiness Advance your own good fortune?
For all the rest, They'll take a suggestion as a cat licks up milk: They'll turn the clock to any business that We say is right for the hour.
Your case, dear friend, Shall be my authority for what I do: as you go to Milan, I'll come by Naples.
Draw your sword: one stroke Shall free you from the taxes which you pay, And I the king shall be devoted to you.
Pull out your sword when I do: And when I raise my hand, you do the same, So that it falls on Gonzalo.
While you lie here snoring, Open-eyed Plotting Takes his time.
If you care about your life, Shake off slumber, and beware.
Now, good angels Preserve the King!
Why, how is it now!
Ho, awake!
Why are your swords drawn?
What's the matter?
It was most terrible to hear.
I heard nothing.
Did you hear this, Gonzalo?
On my honor, sir, I heard a humming, And it was a strange one too, which woke me up.
Lead us away from this place: and let's search further For my poor son.
Heavens protect him from these beasts!
Because he is surely on the island.
Lead us away.
All the diseases that the sun sucks up From bogs, swamps, flats, fall on Prospero and make him A disease inch by inch!
His spirits listen to me, And yet I have to curse.
Here comes a spirit of his, to torment me For bringing in wood too slowly.
I'll fall down flat; Maybe he won’t notice me.
A fish: he smells like a fish: a very old and fish-like smell; a kind that’s not like the freshest small fish.
A strange fish!
When they won’t give a penny to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten dollars to see a dead Indian.
He has legs like a man, and his fins look like arms!
Warm, honestly!
I now give my opinion: hold it no longer; this is no fish, but an islander, that has lately been struck by lightning.
Thunder] Alas, the storm has come again!
I will stay covered here until the last of the storm is over.
This is a nasty tune too: but here's my comfort.
What's the matter?
Do we have devils here?
I have not escaped drowning to be afraid now of your four legs; because it has been said, “As proper a man as ever went on four legs can’t make him give ground”: and it shall be said so again, while Stephano still breathes through His nostrils.
This is some monster of the island with four legs, who has got, as I take it, malaria.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
He's having a fit now and doesn’t talk sense.
Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
His forward voice now is speaking well of his friend; his backward voice is uttering dirty speeches and insults.
If all the wine in my bottle will help him, I will help his malaria.
Come.
Amen!
I will pour some in your other mouth.
Stephano!
Does your other mouth call me?
If you are Trinculo, come out.
You are very Trinculo indeed!
How did you come to be the attack of this dreamer?
Can he spit out Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with lightning.
But aren’t you drowned, Stephano?
I hope now you aren’t drowned.
Hass the storm blown over?
I hid myself under the dead dreamer’s covering because I was afraid of the storm.
And are you living, Stephano?
O Stephano, two Neapolitans escaped!
Please, don’t turn me around so much: my stomach is upset.
How did you escape?
How did you come here?
Swear by this bottle how you came here—I escaped on a barrel of wine, which the sailors heaved overboard, by this bottle!
Which I made of the bark of a tree, with my own hands, since I was cast ashore.
I'll swear on that bottle to be your true subject, because that liquor is not earthly.
Passing the bottle] Here, kiss the book [gives TRINCULO a drink].
Though you can swim like a duck, you are made like a goose.
Have you not dropped from heaven?
Out of the moon, I assure you: I was the Man in the Moon, a long time ago.
The Man in the Moon!
I'll show you every fertile inch of the island; And I will kiss your foot.
Please, be my god.
Come on, then; down, and swear.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.
A most nasty monster!
I could find it in my heart to beat him,— Come, kiss.
I'll show you the best springs; I'll pluck you berries; I'll fish for you, and get you enough wood.
A plague on the tyrant that I serve!
I'll carry no more sticks for him, but follow you, You amazing man.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a a poor drunkard amazing!
Please, let me bring you where crabs grow; And I will dig you peanuts with my long nails; I’ll show you a bird's nest, and teach you how To catch the nimble monkey; I'll bring you To clustering filbert nuts, and sometimes I'll get you Young falcons from the rock.
Will you go with me?
Goodbye, master; goodbye, goodbye!
I'll make no more mothers for fish; Or fetch in firing wood When asked to, Or scrape dishes, or wash dishes; 'Ban 'Ban, Ca—Caliban, Has a new master—Get a new man.
Freedom, high day!
High-day, freedom!
Freedom, high-day, freedom!
O brave monster!
Lead the way. 
This mean task of mine Would be as heavy to me as hateful, except that The mistress I serve makes alive what's dead, And makes my labors pleasurable: Oh!
She is Ten times more gentle than her crabby father, And he's made of harshness.
I forget: But these sweet thoughts even refresh my work, Keep me very busy, at least when I do it.
O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I finish What I must work to do.
If you'll sit down, I'll carry your logs the while.
Please give me that; I'll carry it to the pile.
It would be as natural to me As it is to you: and I should do it Much more easily, because my good will is in it, And yours is against it.
Aside] Poor worm!
You look tired.
No, noble mistress; it is fresh morning with me When you are near at night.
Please— Chiefly that I might say it in my prayers— What is your name?
Miranda—O my father!
I have broken his command not to say so.
Admired Miranda!
Indeed, the top of admiration; worth What's dearest to the world!
So perfect and so peerless, are created Out of every creature's best virtues.
But I jabber on A little too wildly, and there I am forgetting My father's lessons.
Do you love me?
I, Beyond all limit of whatever else in the world, Do love, prize, honor you.
I am a fool To cry at what I am happy about.
Aside] Fair meeting Of two most rare loves!
Heavens rain grace On that which grows between them!
Why do you cry?
At my unworthiness, that dares not offer to you What I desire to give you, or much less take What I shall die to want from you.
But this is a little thing; And it seeks to hide itself all the more, It shows how big it is.
Here, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me; If not, I'll die your virgin.
You may deny me To be your friend; but I'll be your servant, Whether you will want me or not.
My mistress, dearest; And I am humble forever.
My husband, then?
Yes, with a heart as willing As slavery was ever willing of freedom: here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in it: and now goodbye Until half an hour later.
A thousand thousand!
I'll go to my book; Because still, before supper time, I must complete A lot of business relating to these two. 
Servant-monster!
The folly of this island!
They say there's only five on this island; we’re three of them; if the other two are brained like us, the state shakes.
Where else should they be set?
He would be a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
You shall be my lieutenant, monster, or my main officer.
Your lieutenant, if you like; he's no main officer.
We'll not run, Monsieur monster.
Or leave either: but you'll lie like dogs, and still say nothing neither.
Dreamer, speak once in your life, if you are a good dreamer.
How does your honor?
Let me lick your shoe.
I won’t serve him: he’s not valiant.
Why, you deboshed fish you, was there ever a coward that has drunk so much sack as I have today?
Will you tell a monstrous lie, being only half fish and half a monster?
Look, how he mocks me!
Will you let him, my lord?
Look, look again!
Bite him to death, please.
The poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord.
Will it please you to listen once again to the favor I asked you?
As I told you before, I am subject to a tyrant, sorcerer, that has cheated me of the island by his cunning.
You lie.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, I will displace some of your teeth.
Why, I said nothing.
You shall be lord of it, and I'll serve you.
How shall this be done?
Can you bring me to the party?
You lie: you can’t.
What a drunken imbecile is this!
Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word more and, I swear, I'll turn you out of doors, and make a dried fish out of you.
Why, what did I do?
I did nothing.
I'll go farther away.
Didn’t you say he lied?
You lie.
Did I?
Take that.
As you like this, give me the lie again.
Ha, ha, ha!
Beat him enough: after a little time, I'll beat him too.
Stand farther away.—Come on, continue.
Remember To possess his books first, because, without them, He's only a fool, as I am, and hasn’t One spirit to command: they all hate him As deeply as I do.
Is it so brave a girl?
Do you like the plot, Trinculo?
Excellent.
Yes, on my honor.
You make me happy: I am full of pleasure.
At your request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Flout them and scout them; and scout them and flout them: Thought is free.
That's not the tune.
What is this noise?
This is the tune of our song, played by the picture of Nobody.
O, forgive me my sins!
Are you afraid?
No, monster, not me.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about my ears; and sometimes voices, That, if I then had wakened after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds I thought would open and show riches Ready to drop on me; that, when I wakened, I cried to dream again.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.
He lays it on.
Will you come?
I'll follow, Stephano. 
Be patient, I have to rest.
Old lord, I can’t blame you.
I am so exhausted My spirits are dulled; sit down and rest.
Well, let him go.
I am very glad that he's so out of hope.
Don’t, for one denial, lose the action That you swore to do.
We will take the next Advantage thoroughly.
What music is this?
My good friends, listen!
Marvelous sweet music!
Give us kind keepers, heavens!
What were these?
A living puppet show.
Now I will believe That there are unicorns; that in Arabia There is one tree, the throne of the phoenix; one phoenix Reigning there now.
If I should report this now in Naples, Would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw similar islanders,— Because, truly, these are people of the island,— Who, though, they are of monstrous shape, yet, notice that Their manners are more gentle than those of Our human generation that you shall find Many, no, almost any.
Honest lord, What you say is true, because some of you there present Are worse than devils.
Praise in departing.
They vanished strangely.
Not I.
Truly, sir, you don’t need to be afraid.
When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Covered with dew like bulls, who had throats with pockets Of flesh hanging from them?
Or that there were similar men Whose heads were in their chests?
Now we find that One traveler out of five will bring us News about them.
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny, That has the power over this lower world And what is in it,—has caused the never-satisfied sea to spit up you; and on this island Where man doesn’t live, you among men Being most unfit to live.
I have made you crazy: And even with similar courage, men hang and drown Themselves.
You fools!
If you could hurt us, Your swords are now too heavy for your strengths, And won’t be lifted up.
But, remember— Because that's my business to you,—that you three From Milan replaced good Prospero; Exposed him and his innocent child to the sea, Which has repaid it: for which evil deed, The powers, delaying but not forgetting, have Angered the seas and shores, yes, all the creatures, Against your peace of mind.
In the name of something holy, sir, why stand you here In this strange stare?
Therefore my son is embedded in the ooze; and I'll seek him deeper than a piece of lead ever measured How deep the water is, and I will lie there with him in the mud.
Give me only one evil enemy at a time, and I'll fight their legions again and again.
I'll be right behind you.
I beg you, Whose joints move easier than mine to follow them swiftly And stop them from what this vision May now provoke them to do. 
If I have punished you too harshly, Your payment makes up for it, because I Have given you here a third of my own life, Or the part for which I live, who, once again, I give to you.
I would believe it Against a fortuneteller.
What, Ariel!
My hard-working servant, Ariel!
What would my powerful master like?
Here I am.
You and your meaner fellows performed your last jobs Very well, and I must use you In another similar trick.
Right now?
Yes, with a twink.
Before you can say, “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and cry “so, so,” Each one, tripping on his toe, Will be here with tricks and pranks.
Do you love me, master?
No?
Dearly, my delicate Ariel.
Don’t come near Until you hear me call.
Well, I understand.
I promise you, sir, The cold, white, virgin snow on my heart Holds back my passion.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!
Bring a conclusion, Rather than need a spirit: appear, and quickly.
No talking!
All eyes!
Be silent.
Approach, rich Ceres, to entertain her.
To celebrate a contract of true love, And to bestow some free gifts On the blessed lovers.
Tell me, heavenly rainbow, if you know, If Venus the goddess of love or Cupid, her son, Now wait on the queen?
Since they plotted With the dark god of the underworld to kidnap my daughter, I have sworn not to be in Her and her blind boy's scandalous company.
Don’t be afraid Of her company.
They thought they would do Some naughty charm on this man and maiden, Who have vowed that they will not sleep together Until the god of marriage's torch is lit, but they thought so in vain.
Highest Queen of State, Great Juno comes; I know her by her walk.
How does my generous sister?
Go with me To bless these two, that they may be prosperous, And honored in their children.
Honor, riches, marriage-blessing, Long life, and many children, Hourly joys be always yours!
Juno sings her blessings on you.
Earth's increase, plenty of feasting, Barns and storage for game never empty; Vines growing with clustering bunches of grapes; Plants bowing with heavy loads of fruit ; Spring come to you as long as possible, Even to the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall ignore you; Ceres' blessing so be on you.
Spirits, which, by my magic, I have called from their borders to enact My present wishes.
Sweet now, silence!
You nymphs, called Water Nymphs, of the winding brooks, With your oat-edged crowns and always harmless looks, Leave your fresh waters, and answer your summons To this green land: Juno commands you.
You sun-burned reapers, tired of August, Come here from the rows you have plowed and be happy: Make it a holiday: put on your rye-straw hats, And meet every one pf these fresh nymphs In country dancing.
Well done!
avoid; no more!
These our actors, As I told you before, were all spirits and Have melted into air, into thin air: And, like the invisible fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great world itself, Yes, all who inherit it, shall dissolve And leave not even a clue behind, As this pageant of no substance faded.
Don’t be disturbed by my weakness.
We wish your peace.
I hang onto your thoughts.
What's your pleasure?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Tell me again, where did you leave these varlets?
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; So full of smoothness that they beat the air For breathing in their faces; beat the ground For kissing their feet; yet always bending Towards their project.
Well done, my bird.
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Kindness can never stick; on whom my pains, Taken humanely are all, all lost, quite lost; And as his body grows uglier with age, So his mind is diseased.
I will plague them all, Even to the point of their roaring.
Come, hang them on this line.
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played us for fools.
Monster, I smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is highly offended.
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you,— You were only a lost monster.
I will fetch off my bottle, although I’ll be head over heels in muck for my efforts.
Please, my king, be quiet.
Do that good deed which may make this island Your own forever, and I, your Caliban, Your foot-licker forever.
O King Stephano!
O peer!
O worthy Stephano!
Look what a wardrobe is here for you!
Let it alone, you fool; it is only trash.
O, ho, monster!
Your Grace shall have it.
The swelling disease drown this fool!
What do you mean By being so stupidly fond like this on such goods?
Let's get going And do the murder first.
If he awakens, He'll fill our skins with pinches from toe to head; Turn us into strange stuff.
I’ll have none of it.
We shall lose our opportunity, And we’ll all be turned into geese, or into apes With villainous, low foreheads.
Go on; carry this.
And this.
Yes, and this.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Silver!
There it goes, Silver!
Fury, Fury!
There, Tyrant, there!
Go, order my goblins that they torment their joints With dry convulsions; shorten up their muscles With long-lasting cramps, and make them more spotted With pinches than a leopard, or mountain cat.
Listen, they roar.
Let them be hunted soundly.
What time is it?
Six o’clock, at which time, my lord, You said our work should end.
I said so When first I raised the storm.
Tell me, my spirit, How are the King and his followers doing?
Confined together In the same fashion as you told me; Just as you left them: all prisoners, sir, In the grove of trees which weatherproofs your dwelling; They can’t budge until you release them.
Do you think so, spirit?
Mine would, sir, if I were human.
Go release them, Ariel.
I'll break my spells, I'll restore their senses, And they shall be themselves again.
I'll fetch them, sir.
You elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves; And you that chase the ebbing ocean on the sands Without leaving a foot print, and run from him When he comes back; you half-puppets that Make the green ringlets sour by moonshine, Where the ewe doesn’t bite; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms that are happy To hear the curfew sound; by whose aid,— Weak masters though you are,—I have dimmed The noontide sun, called the mutinous winds, And set roaring between the green sea and The blue sky: I haven given fire to the dreaded Rattling thunder, and split Jove's stout oak With his own lightning bolt: I have made the strong-based Land that stuck out into the ocean shake; and plucked up The pine and cedar by the roots: at my command, graves Have awakened the dead, opened the coffins, and Let them walk out by my so powerful magic.
A solemn song, and the best comforter To an unsettled mind, cure for your brains, Now useless, boiled inside your skull!
Holy Gonzalo, honorable man, My eyes, even sociable to the show of your eyes, Cry like yours.
The charm dissolves quickly; And as the morning steals on into the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that cloud Their clearer reason.—O good Gonzalo!
Their understanding Begins to increase, and the approaching tide of understanding Will shortly fill the reasonable shores of their minds That are now corrupt and muddy.
Where the bee sucks, there suck I: In a flower’s bell I lie; There I sleep when owls cry.
Why, that's my delicate Ariel!
I drink in the air before me, and return Before your pulse beats twice.
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement Live here.
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!
First, noble friend, Let me embrace you, whose honor can’t Be measured or confined.
I won’t swear whether this is Or is not true.
The devil speaks in him.
No.
Because you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I forgive Your worst fault, all of them, and require My dukedom from you, which I know You must restore to me by necessity.
If you are Prospero, Give us details of how you were saved; How you have met us here, who were wrecked On this shore three hours ago, where I have lost,— How sharp the point of this memory is!— My dear son Ferdinand.
I am very sorry about it, sir.
The loss cannot be repaid, and patience Says it is beyond her cure.
I rather think You haven’t sought her help, by whose soft grace, I have received her royal aid for a similar loss, And I am at peace.
You a similar loss!
As great to me, as recently; and, to make the dear Loss tolerable, I have much weaker means Than you have to comfort you, because I Have lost my daughter.
A daughter?
When did you lose your daughter?
In this last storm.
I see these lords So much admire at this meeting That they eat their own common sense, and scarcely think Their eyes tell them the truth.
Their words Are natural breath, but, however you have Been jostled out of your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Who was thrown out of Milan, who most strangely landed On this shore, where you were wrecked, To be the lord of it.
No more yet about this; Because it is a story of day by day, Not a story for a breakfast or Befitting this first meeting.
Here I have few attendants And subjects none.
Please, look in.
Since you have given me my dukedom again, I will repay you with just as good a thing; At least bring out a wonder, to make you as happy As I am to have my dukedom.
Sweet lord, you lie to me.
No, my dearest love, I wouldn’t for the world.
Yes, you would argue for a score of kingdoms, And I would call it fair play.
If this proves to be A vision of the island, I shall lose One dear son twice.
A most high miracle!
Now all the blessings Of a glad father are all around you!
Stand up, and say how you came here.
O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beautiful mankind is!
O brave new world That has such people in it!
It’s new to you.
Who is this maiden with whom you were at play?
Sir, she is mortal; But, by immortal Providence, she's mine.
I chose her when I couldn’t ask my father For his advice, or didn’t think I had a father.
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Who I have so often heard has a great reputation, But that I never saw before; of whom I have Received a second life: and this lady makes him A second father to me.
I am hers: Only, Oh!
How oddly it will sound that I Must ask my child for forgiveness!
I have wept inside, Or should have spoken before this.
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
Was the Duke of Milan thrown out of Milan, that his children Should become kings of Naples?
O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars.
In one voyage, Claribel found her husband at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero found his dukedom In a poor island; and all of us found ourselves, When no man was in his right minds.
Let it be so.
Amen!
Here are more of us.
I prophesied That, if a gallows were on land, this fellow could not drown.
Now, you blasphemer, who sent grace overboard with Swearing, don’t you have an oath on shore?
Don’t you Have any mouth on land?
What’s the news?
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company: the next, our ship,— Which only three hours ago was wrecked, we thought— Is water-tight and ready, and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.
Sir, I have done all this service Since I left you.
If I thought, sir, that I was well awake, I'd try to tell you.
Bravely, my hard worker.
You shall be free.
How are you, my gracious sir?
There are still some few odd lads Missing from your company that you forget.
Every man is on his own for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself, because all is only fortune.—Coragio!
bully-monster, Coragio!
If these are true eyes in my head, here's a goodly sight.
O Setebos, these are brave spirits indeed.
How fine my master is!
I’m afraid He will beat me.
Ha, ha!
What are these things, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy them?
Very likely; one of them Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
I shall be pinched to death.
Isn’t this Stephano, my drunken butler?
I have been in similar a pickle since I saw you last that, I’m afraid, will never get out of my bones.
I won’t be afraid of blow flies.
Why, how is it now, Stephano!
Oh!
Don’t touch me: I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
You'd be king of the island, servant?
I should have been a sore one, then.
This is as strange a thing as I have ever looked on.
Yes, I will; and I'll be wise hereafter, And seek for grace.
What a three times two ass I was, to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool!
Get going; away!
Here, and your baggage back where you found it.
Or stole it, rather.
I long To hear the story of your life, which must Affect the ear strangely.
