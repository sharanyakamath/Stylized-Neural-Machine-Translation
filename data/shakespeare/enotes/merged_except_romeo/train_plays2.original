Who's there?
Nay, answer me.
Stand and unfold yourself.
Long live the King!
Bernardo?
He.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
tis now struck twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.
For this relief much thanks.
tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.
Have you had quiet guard?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
I think I hear them.
Stand, ho!
Who is there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
Bernardo hath my place.
Give you good night.
Say, What, is Horatio there?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, good Marcellus.
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one— Peace!
Look where it comes again!
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Looks it not like the King?
Mark it, Horatio.
Most like.
It harrows me with fear and wonder.
It would be spoke to.
Question it, Horatio.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march?
By heaven I charge thee speak!
It is offended.
See, it stalks away!
Stay!
speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!
tis gone, and will not answer.
How now, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
Is it not like the King?
As thou art to thyself.
tis strange.
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Who is't that can inform me?
That can I; At least the whisper goes so.
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of feared events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.
Lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.
Stay illusion!
stay, and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus!
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do, if it will not stand.
tis here!
tis here!
tis gone!
We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons.
I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day, and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Let's do't, I pray: and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. 
Nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along.
For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother.
So much for him.
Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras— Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose—to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
In that and all things will we show our duty.
We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit.
What is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so, my lord: I am too much i' the sun.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Ay, madam, it is common.
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?
Seems, madam?
Nay, it is.
Fie!
tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died today, This must be so.
We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you.
For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee, stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark.
Come away.
O God!
God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't!
ah, fie!
tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.
That it should come to this!
But two months dead!
Heaven and earth!
Must I remember?
Frailty, thy name is woman— A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears—why she, even she— O God!
a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer—married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules.
Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married.
O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not, nor it cannot come to, good.
But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well.
Horatio—or I do forget myself.
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?— Marcellus?
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.
I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio.
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father—methinks I see my father.
O, where, my lord?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
He was a man, take him for all in all; I shall not look upon his like again.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, the King your father.
The King my father?
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
For God's love let me hear!
But where was this?
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Did you not speak to it?
My lord, I did; But answer made it none.
tis very strange.
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Hold you the watch tonight?
We do, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?
O, yes, my lord!
He wore his beaver up.
What, look'd he frowningly?
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Pale, or red?
Nay, very pale.
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.
Very like, very like.
Stay'd it long?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Longer, longer.
Not when I saw't.
His beard was grizzled, no?
It was as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.
I warrant it will.
If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
I will requite your loves.
So, fare you well.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.
Our duty to your honour.
Your loves, as mine to you.
Farewell.
My father's spirit in arms!
Would the night were come.
Till then sit still, my soul.
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. 
My necessaries are embark'd.
Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.
Do you doubt that?
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favours, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Think it no more.
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal.
He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head.
Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes.
The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not!
I stay too long.
But here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for.
There, my blessing with thee.
And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell.
My blessing season this in thee!
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Farewell.
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Marry, well bethought!
What is between you?
Give me up the truth.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
Affection?
Pooh!
You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Marry, I'll teach you.
Think yourself a baby, That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you'll tender me a fool.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.
These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire.
For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you.
In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds, The better to beguile.
Look to't, I charge you.
Come your ways.
I shall obey, my lord. 
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.
No, it is struck.
Indeed?
I heard it not.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What doth this mean, my lord?
The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels, And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?
Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth—wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin— By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men— Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star— Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo— Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault.
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.
O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements, why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.
What may this mean That thou, dead corse, again, in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this?
Wherefore?
What should we do?
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it!
No, by no means.
It will not speak; then will I follow it.
Do not, my lord!
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again.
I'll follow it.
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness?
Think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands!
You shall not go.
My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I say, away!
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Have after.
To what issue will this come?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow him. 
Whither wilt thou lead me?
Speak!
I'll go no further.
Mark me.
I will.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
What!
I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away.
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.
List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love— O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder?
Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.
Now, Hamlet, hear.
tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard, A serpent stung me.
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle!
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!
But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage.
But soft!
O, horrible!
O, horrible!
most horrible!
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught.
Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once.
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu!
Remember me.
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
What else?
And shall I couple hell?
O, fie!
Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.
Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter.
Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are.
Now to my word: It is ‘Adieu, adieu!
Remember me.’ I have sworn't.
My lord, my lord!
So be it!
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.
How is't, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.
No; you will reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
Nor I, my lord.
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I am sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, faith, heartily.
There's no offence, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too.
Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desire to know what is between us O'ermaster't as you may.
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
What is't, my lord?
We will.
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
My lord, we will not.
Nay, but swear't.
In faith, My lord, not I.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Swear.
Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on!
Propose the oath, my lord.
Swear.
Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard: Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Well said, old mole!
Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner!
Once more remove, good friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Swear.
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint.
O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together. 
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behaviour.
My lord, I did intend it.
Marry, well said, very well said.
Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends, And in part him.’ Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Ay, very well, my lord.
And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well.
As gaming, my lord?
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing.
You may go so far.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency.
That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?
Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Marry, sir, here's my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And then, sir, does he this—he does—what was I about to say?
So, by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son.
You have me, have you not?
My lord, I have.
Good my lord!
Observe his inclination in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him play his music.
Well, my lord.
Farewell!
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
With what, i' the name of God?
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced, No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled, Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know, But truly I do fear it.
What said he?
He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it.
Come, go with me.
I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
No, my good lord; but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.
I fear'd he did but trifle And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
Come, go we to the King.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. 
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.
What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.
I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time; so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That open'd lies within our remedy.
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres.
If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance.
Both your Majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Ay, amen!
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord?
Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King.
And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper.
I doubt it is no other but the main, His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome, my good friends.
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time we'll read, Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home!
This business is well ended.
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this.
Now gather, and surmise.
Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans.
But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it.
Adieu.
Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet.
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.
But how hath she Receiv'd his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honourable.
I would fain prove so.
Do you think 'tis this?
It may be, very like.
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said ‘'tis so,’ When it proved otherwise?
Not that I know.
Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.
How may we try it further?
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter.
If he love her not, And he not from his reason fall'n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.
We will try it.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
O, give me leave.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well, God-a-mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Not I, my lord.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord?
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a daughter?
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.
Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to't.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.
He is far gone.
And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love, very near this.
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am if, if like a crab, you could go backward.
Into my grave?
Indeed, that is out of the air.
Aside.
How sometimes his replies are!
a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Fare you well, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
God save you, sir!
My honoured lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do ye both?
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
Faith, her privates we.
In the secret parts of Fortune?
What news?
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Prison, my lord?
Denmark's a prison.
Then is the world one.
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
To me it is a prison.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to the court?
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.
We'll wait upon you.
No such matter!
I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended.
But in the beaten way of friend- ship, what make you at Elsinore?
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you; And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were you not sent for?
Is it your own inclin- ing?
Is it a free visitation?
Come, deal justly with me.
What should we say, my lord?
Why, anything, but to the purpose.
You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour.
I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.
To what end, my lord?
That you must teach me.
But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.
What say you?
My lord, we were sent for.
I have of late—but wherefore I know not— lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man!
how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty!
in form and moving how express and admirable!
in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god!
And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?
Man delights not me—no, nor woman nei- ther, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said man delights not me?
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you.
We coted them on the way, and hither are they com- ing to offer you service.
What players are they?
Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.
How chances it they travel?
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
Are they so followed?
No, indeed, are they not.
How comes it?
Do they grow rusty?
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't.
These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
What, are they children?
Who maintains 'em?
How are they escoted?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controver- sy.
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
Is't possible?
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Do the boys carry it away?
Ay, that they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too.
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Your hands, come!
Then appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.
Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players—which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards—should more appear like entertainment than yours.
You are welcome.
But my uncle-father and aunt- mother are deceived.
In what, my dear lord?
I am but mad north-north-west.
When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players.
Mark it.
You say right, sir; o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
Buzz, buzz!
Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.
For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
What treasure had he, my lord?
Why, ‘One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well.’ Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
Nay, that follows not.
What follows then, my lord?
Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was.— The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look where my abridgment comes.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.
I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.
What, my young lady and mistress?
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine.
Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.
Masters, you are all welcome.
We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see.
We'll have a speech straight.
Come, give us a taste of your quality.
Come, a passionate speech.
What speech, my good lord?
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much mod- esty as cunning.
I remember one said there were no sal- lets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no mat- ter in the phrase that might indict the author of affecta- tion; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine.
Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick'd With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons.
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks.
His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command.
Unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls.
Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.
For lo!
his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick.
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing.
But as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death—anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour, forged for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune!
All you gods, In general synod take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends!
This is too long.
It shall to the barber's, with your beard.
Prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.
Say on; come to Hecuba.
mobled queen’ is good.
Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o'erteemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up— Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced.
But if the gods themselves did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made Unless things mortal move them not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And passion in the gods.
Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.
Prithee no more!
tis well.
I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd?
Do you hear?
Let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.
After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
God's bodykins, man, much better!
Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends.
We'll hear a play to-morrow.
Dost thou hear me, old friend?
We'll ha't tomorrow night.
Ay, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night.
You are wel- come to Elsinore.
Good my lord!
Ay, so, God be wi' ye!
Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit?
And all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?
What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have?
He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain?
breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose?
gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs?
Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I!
This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion!
Fie upon't!
Foh!
About, my brain!
Hum, I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle.
I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick.
If he but blench, I know my course.
I'll have grounds More relative than this.
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. 
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from what cause he will by no means speak.
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.
Did you assay him To any pastime?
Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way.
Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it.
They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
tis most true; And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights.
We shall, my lord.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia.
Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him, as he is behaved, If't be the affliction of his love or no, That thus he suffers for.
So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, walk you here.
Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.
Read on this book, That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness.
We are oft to blame in this— 'tis too much proved—that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The Devil himself.
O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burden!
I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of disprized love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.
Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!
Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.
Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
Are you honest?
My lord?
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.
I did love you once.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it.
I loved you not.
I was the more deceived.
Get thee to a nunnery!
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.
What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven?
We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
At home, my lord.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house.
Farewell.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.
Get thee to a nunnery.
Go, farewell.
Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
O heavenly powers, restore him!
You jig, you amble, and you lisp; and nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.
I say, we will have no more marriages.
Those that are married already—all but one—shall live; the rest shall keep as they are.
To a nunnery, go.
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy.
O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Love?
His affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness.
There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different, With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself.
What think you on't?
It shall do well.
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.
How now, Ophelia?
My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play, Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief.
Let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference.
If she find him not, To England send him; or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. 
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.
Pray you avoid it.
I warrant your honour.
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.
Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.
Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.
O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
O, reform it altogether!
That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go make you ready.
How now, my lord?
Will the King hear this piece of work?
And the Queen too, and that presently.
We will, my lord.
What, ho, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.
Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice, And could of men distinguish her election, Sh'hath seal'd thee for herself.
For thou hast been As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing; A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please.
Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.
Something too much of this.
There is a play tonight before the King.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance, Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle.
If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy.
Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.
Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
They are coming to the play.
I must be idle.
Get you a place.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish.
I eat the air, promise-cramm'd.
You cannot feed capons so.
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you play'd once i' th' university, you say?
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me.
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.
Be the players ready.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
O, ho!
do you mark that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Ay, my lord.
Do you think I meant country matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, I?
Ay, my lord.
O God, your only jig-maker!
What should a man do but be merry?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two hours.
Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.
O heavens!
die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ay, or any show that you'll show him.
Be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
You are naught, you are naught!
I'll mark the play.
For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently.
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
tis brief, my lord.
As woman's love.
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
That I distrust you.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who killed the first.
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed.
I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
If she should break it now!
tis deeply sworn.
Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain!
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?
Is there no offence in't?
No, no!
They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world.
What do you call the play?
The Mousetrap.
Marry, how?
Tropically.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
tis a knavish piece of work; but what o' that?
Your Majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not.
Let the galled jade winch; our withers are unwrung.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Still better, and worse.
So you must take your husbands.
Begin, murderer.
Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin!
He poisons him i' the garden for his estate.
His name's Gonzago.
The King rises.
What, frighted with false fire?
How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.
Give me some light.
Away!
Lights, lights, lights!
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers—if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me—with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
Half a share.
You might have rhymed.
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound!
Didst perceive?
Very well, my lord.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
I did very well note him.
Ah, ha!
Come, some music!
Come, some music!
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Sir, a whole history.
The King, sir— Ay, sir, what of him?
Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord; rather with choler.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor; for, me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
I am tame, sir.
Pronounce.
The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you.
You are welcome.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother.
Therefore no more, but to the matter!
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Have you any further trade with us?
My lord, you once did love me.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.
Sir, I lack advancement.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark?
Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'—the proverb is something musty.
O, the recorders!
Let me see one.
To withdraw with you— why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?
My lord, I cannot.
I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
It is as easy as lying.
Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak.
Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.
God bless you, sir!
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then will I come to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
By and by' is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on.
Soft!
now to my mother!
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his brows.
We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty.
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many.
The cess of majesty Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw What's near it with it.
It is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.
Never alone Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.
We will haste us.
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process.
I'll warrant she'll tax him home; And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage.
Fare you well, my liege.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.
Thanks, dear my lord.
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow?
Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being down?
Then I'll look up; My fault is past.
But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn?
Forgive me my foul murder?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder— My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
What then?
What rests?
Try what repentance can.
What can it not?
O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged!
Help, angels!
Make assay.
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
All may be well.
That would be scann'd.
A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
He took my father grossly, full of bread, With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
No.
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage; Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At game, a-swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes.
My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. 
He will come straight.
Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him.
I'll silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
Withdraw; I hear him coming.
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Why, how now, Hamlet?
What's the matter now?
Have you forgot me?
No, by the rood, not so!
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife, And—would it were not so—you are my mother.
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
What, ho!
Help, help, help!
Draws.
O, I am slain!
O me, what hast thou done?
Nay, I know not.
Is it the King?
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
A bloody deed.
Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
As kill a king?
Ay, lady, it was my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better.
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace!
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?
Heaven's face doth glow; Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act.
Ay me, what act, That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
Look here upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear Blasting his wholesome brother.
Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this Moor?
Ha!
have you eyes?
What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope.
O shame!
where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire.
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn, And reason panders will.
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.
Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty!
No more!
A king of shreds and patches!
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards!
What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he's mad!
Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command?
O, say!
Do not forget.
This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
How is it with you, lady?
Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy, And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements, Start up and stand on end.
O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience!
Whereon do you look?
On him, on him!
Look you how pale he glares!
Then what I have to do Will want true colour—tears perchance for blood.
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nor did you nothing hear?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look you there!
Look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.
Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music.
It is not madness That I have utt'red.
Bring me to the test, And I the matter will reword; which madness Would gambol from.
Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen.
Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker.
Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half, Good night—but go not to my uncle's bed.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on.
Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence; the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And [either master] the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency.
For this same lord, I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so, To punish me with this, and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him.
So again, good night.
One word more, good lady.
What shall I do?
Twere good you let him know; For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib Such dear concernings hide?
Who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep And break your own neck down.
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.
I must to England; you know that?
Alack, I had forgot!
Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar; and ' shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon.
O, 'tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet.
Mother, good night.
Indeed, this counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother. 
There's matter in these sighs.
Where is your son?
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How does Hamlet?
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier.
In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!
And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man.
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all, To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt This mad young man.
But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit, But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life.
Where is he gone?
He weeps for what is done.
O Gertrude, come away!
Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I pray you haste in this.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what's untimely done.
So haply slander Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name And hit the woundless air.—O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay. 
Safely stow'd.
Hamlet!
Lord Hamlet!
What noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
Do not believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own.
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, his authorities.
But such officers do the King best service in the end.
He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouth'd, to be last swallowed.
When he needs what you have glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
I understand you not, my lord.
I am glad of it.
A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
The King is a thing— A thing, my lord?
Of nothing.
Bring me to him.
Hide fox, and all after. 
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence.
To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause.
Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all.
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, We cannot get from him.
But where is he?
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper.
At supper?
Where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him.
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.
Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table.
That's the end.
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
What dost thou mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send thither to see.
If your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself.
But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stair, into the lobby.
Go seek him there.
He will stay till you come.
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety— Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done—must send thee hence With fiery quickness.
For England?
Ay, Hamlet.
Good.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
I see a cherub that sees them.
But come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
My mother!
Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother.
Come, for England!
Delay it not; I'll have him hence tonight.
Away!
for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair.
Pray you, make haste.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught— As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us—thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.
Till I know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. 
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom.
You know the rendezvous.
If that his Majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so.
I will do't, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose powers are these?
They are of Norway, sir.
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw.
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies.
I humbly thank you, sir.
God be wi' you, sir.
Will't please you go, my lord?
I'll be with you straight.
Go a little before.
How all occasions do inform against me And spur my dull revenge!
What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed?
A beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused.
Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event— A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward—I do not know Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,' Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do't.
Examples gross as earth exhort me.
Witness this army, of such mass and charge, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd, Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell.
Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake.
How stand I then, That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep, while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain?
O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! 
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Let her come in.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
How should I your true love know From another one?
By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon.
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Say you?
Nay, pray you, mark.
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone.
Nay, but Ophelia— Pray you, mark.
White his shroud as the mountain snow— Alas, look here, my lord!
Larded all with sweet flowers; Which bewept to the grave did not go With true-love showers.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'eild you!
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
God be at your table!
Conceit upon her father.
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es And dupp'd the chamber door, Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more.
Pretty Ophelia!
Indeed, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't if they come to't By Cock, they are to blame.
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient.
But I can- not choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
My brother shall know of it.
And so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach!
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death.
O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death.
Alack, what noise is this?
Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?
Save yourself, my lord.
The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O'erbears your offices.
The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known— The ratifiers and props of every word— They cry 'Choose we!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
The doors are broke.
Where is this King?
Sirs, stand you all without.
No, let's come in!
I pray you give me leave.
We will, we will!
I thank you.
Keep the door.
O thou vile king, Give me my father!
Calmly, good Laertes.
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard; Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brows Of my true mother.
What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
There's such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will.
Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed.
Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
Where is my father?
Dead.
But not by him!
How came he dead?
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation.
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world!
And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.
Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms And, like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.
Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye.
Let her come in.
How now?
What noise is that?
O heat, dry up my brains!
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens!
is't possible a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.
They bore him barefac'd on the bier (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony) And on his grave rain'd many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.
It is the false stew- ard, that stole his master's daughter.
This nothing's more than matter.
There's fennel for you, and columbines.
There's rue for you, and here's some for me.
There's a daisy.
I would give you some violets, but they with- er'd all when my father died.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead; Go to thy deathbed; He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan.
God 'a'mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.
God be wi' you.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.
Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content.
His means of death, his obscure burial— No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation, Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call't in question.
So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you go with me. 
What are they that would speak with me?
Seafaring men, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them come in.
I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless thee too.
He shall, sir, an't please him.
Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd this, give these fellows some means to the King.
They have letters for him.
Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase.
Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them.
On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner.
Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.
I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.
These good fellows will bring thee where I am.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England.
Of them I have much to tell thee.
Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.
Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And do't the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. 
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
It well appears.
But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd up.
O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, But yet to me they are strong.
The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself— My virtue or my plague, be it either which— She's so conjunctive to my life and soul That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her.
The other motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the general gender bear him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim'd them.
And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections.
But my revenge will come.
Break not your sleeps for that.
You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger, And think it pastime.
You shortly shall hear more.
What news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
From Hamlet?
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
What should this mean?
Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Know you the hand?
tis Hamlet's character.
I'm lost in it, my lord.
But let him come.
how otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?
Ay my lord, So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
To thine own peace.
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine.
Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one; and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.
What part is that, my lord?
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness.
Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy— I have seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback; but this gallant Had witchcraft in't.
He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast.
So far he topp'd my thought That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
Upon my life, Lamord.
The very same.
I know him well.
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.
Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his own too much.
That we would do, We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing.
But to the quick o' the ulcer!
Hamlet comes back.
What would you undertake To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words?
To cut his throat i' the church.
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads.
He, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, Requite him for your father.
I will do't!
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death This is but scratch'd withal.
I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.
Therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold If this did blast in proof.
Soft!
let me see.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings— I ha't!
When in your motion you are hot and dry— As make your bouts more violent to that end— And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there.
How now, sweet Queen?
One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow.
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
Drown'd!
O, where?
Alas, then she is drown'd?
Drown'd, drown'd.
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will.
When these are gone, The woman will be out.
Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze But that this folly drowns it.
Let's follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage.
Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own defence?
Why, 'tis found so.
It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else.
For se offendendo; it cannot be else.
Here lies the water—good.
Here stands the man—good.
But is this law?
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Will you ha' the truth on't?
If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
Why, there thou say'st!
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian.
Come, my spade!
There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They hold up Adam's profession.
Was he a gentleman?
A was the first that ever bore arms.
Why, he had none.
What, art a heathen?
How dost thou under- stand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he dig without arms?
I'll put another question to thee.
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
I like thy wit well, in good faith.
To't again, come!
Who builds stronger than a mason, a ship- wright, or a carpenter?
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Marry, now I can tell!
To't.
Mass, I cannot tell.
Go, get thee in Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.
In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet; To contract—O—the time for—a—my behove, O, methought there—a—was nothing—a meet.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
tis e'en so.
The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.
How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if 'were Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!
This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?
It might, my lord.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, sweet lord?
This might be my Lord Such-a- one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?
Ay, my lord.
Why, e'en so!
and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd about the mazard with a sexton's spade.
Here's fine revolution, and we had the trick to see't.
Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggets with 'em?
Mine ache to think on't.
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet; O, a Pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
There's another.
Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?
Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?
Hum!
This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries.
Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt?
Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures?
The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.
I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave's this, sir- rah?
Mine, sir.
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it' 'tis thine.
tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman then?
For none, neither.
Who is to be buried in't?
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolute the knave is!
We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, this three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.
How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
A shall recover his wits there; or, if a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
Why?
Twill not he seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.
How 'strangely'?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in—he will last you some eight year or nine year.
A tanner will last you nine year.
Why he more than another?
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that a will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull, now.
This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty years.
Whose was it?
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was.
Whose do you think it was?
Nay, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!
A poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the King's jester.
This?
E'en that.
Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
My gorge rises at it.
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.
Where be your gibes now?
your gambols?
your songs?
your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar?
Not one now to mock your own grinning?
Quite chop-fallen?
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
What's that, my lord?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
Pah!
E'en so, my lord.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
But soft!
Who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites?
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life.
Twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
What ceremony else?
That is Laertes, a very noble youth.
Mark.
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty.
Must there no more be done?
Lay her i' the earth; And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.
What, the fair Ophelia?
Sweets to the sweet!
Farewell.
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave.
O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!
Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of this flat a mountain you have made To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear.
Hold off thy hand!
Pluck them asunder.
Gentlemen!
Good my lord, be quiet.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?
O, he is mad, Laertes.
For love of God, forbear him!
Swounds, show me what thou'lt do.
I'll do't.
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart!
Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.
I loved you ever.
But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
We'll put the matter to the present push.— Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument.
So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
Remember it, my lord!
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.
such bugs and goblins in my life, That on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.
Is't possible?
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
I beseech you.
Being thus benetted round with villainies— Or I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play—I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service.
Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?
Ay, good my lord.
An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such like as's of great charge, That on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd.
How was this seal'd?
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon— He that hath kill'd my king, and whored my mother; Popp'd in between the election and my hopes; Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage—is't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm?
And is't not to be damn'd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
It will be short; the interim is mine, And a man's life's is no more than to say 'One.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself, For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his.
I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.
Peace, who comes here?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Dost know this water-fly?
No, my good lord.
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.
He hath much land, and fertile.
Let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the pos- session of dirt.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.
Put your bonnet to his right use.
tis for the head.
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere—I can- not tell how.
But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing.
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gen- tleman would see.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gen- tleman in our more rawer breath?
Sir?
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will to't, sir, really.
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
Of him, sir.
Well, sir?
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.
That's two of his weapons.
But, well.
What call you the carriages?
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more German to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
But on!
Why is this 'impawned,' as you call it?
How if I answer no?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.
If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me.
Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it.
Thus has he—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall.
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or when- soever, provided I be so able as now.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
She well instructs me.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I do not think so.
Since he went into France I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart.
But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord— It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
The readiness is all.
Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give me your pardon, sir.
This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd With sore distraction.
What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
Who does it, then?
His madness.
Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o'er the house And hurt my brother.
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge.
But in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor'd.
But till that time I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it.
I embrace it freely, And will this brother's wager frankly play.— Give us the foils.
Come on.
Come, one for me.
I'll be your foil, Laertes.
In mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.
You mock me, sir.
No, by this hand.
Give them the foils, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
I do not fear it, I have seen you both; But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
This likes me well.
These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn.
Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judgment!
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Well, again!
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health.
Give him the cup.
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come.
A touch, a touch; I do confess.
Our son shall win.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Good madam!
Gertrude, do not drink.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam—by-and-by.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.
And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Come for the third, Laertes!
Say you so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
Have at you now!
Part them!
They are incensed.
Look to the Queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides.
How is it, my lord?
How is't, Laertes?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
How does the Queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.
No, no!
I am poison'd.
O villainy!
Ho!
let the door be lock'd.
Treachery!
Seek it out.
It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good.
The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me.
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Thy mother's poison'd.
I can no more.
The King, the King's to blame.
The point envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
Treason!
treason!
O, yet defend me, friends!
I am but hurt.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion!
Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me!
Heaven make thee free of it!
I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio.
Wretched Queen, adieu!
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Romanthan a Dane.
Here's yet some liquor left.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.
I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
Now cracks a noble heart.
Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
Where is this sight?
What is it you will see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
This quarry cries on havoc.
O proud Death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?
Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about.
So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts; Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters; Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause; And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads.
All this can I Truly deliver.
Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royal; and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies.
Hence!
home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Why, sir, a carpenter.
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
But what trade art thou?
Answer me directly.
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe con- science, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
What trade, thou knave?
Thou naughty knave, what trade?
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
What mean'st thou by that?
Mend me, thou saucy- fellow!
Why, sir, cobble you.
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl.
I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them.
As proper men as ever trod upon neats-leather have gone upon my handiwork.
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work.
But indeed, sir, we make holiday, to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
Wherefore rejoice?
What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome, To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey?
Many a time and oft Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements, To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops, Your infants in your arms, and there have sat The live-long day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear, Have you not made an universal shout, That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude.
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault, Assemble all the poor men of your sort, Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears Into the channel, till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
See, whether their basest metal be not moved; They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol; This way will I. Disrobe the images, If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
It is no matter; let no images Be hung with Caesar's trophies.
I'll about, And drive away the vulgar from the streets; So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
Caesar speaks.
Stand you directly in Antonio's way, When he doth run his course.
I shall remember.
When Caesar says “Do this,” it is perform'd.
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
Caesar!
Ha!
Who calls?
Peace yet again!
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, Cry “Caesar.” Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
Beware the ides of March.
What man is that?
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Set him before me; let me see his face.
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
What say'st thou to me now?
Speak once again.
Beware the ides of March.
He is a dreamer; let us leave him.
Pass.
Will you go see the order of the course?
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; I'll leave you.
Brutus, I do observe you now of late; I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have; You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you.
Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors; But let not therefore my good friends be grieved— Among which number, Cassius, be you one— Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things.
Tis just, And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow.
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus, And groaning underneath this age's yoke, Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear, And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus; Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
What means this shouting?
I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king.
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
What is it that you would impart to me?
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life, but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself.
So indeed he did.
And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature, and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake.
I did hear him groan.
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Brutus, and Caesar: what should be in that Caesar?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em, Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great?
Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous; What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times, I shall recount hereafter; for this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved.
What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today.
But, look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train: Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Caesar?
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous; He is a noble Roman and well given.
Would he were fatter!
He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today, That Caesar looks so sad.
Why, you were with him, were you not?
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him: he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.
What was the second noise for?
Why, for that too.
They shouted thrice.
What was the last cry for?
Why, for that too.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted.
Who offered him the crown?
Why, Antony.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it.
It was mere foolery; I did not mark it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown, yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets and, as I told you, he put it by once.
But for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.
But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.
And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
What, did Caesar swound?
He fell down in the market-place and foamed at mouth and was speechless.
No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I, And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down.
If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
What said he when he came unto himself?
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut.
When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
But there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
And after that, he came thus sad away?
Ay.
Did Cicero say anything?
Ay, he spoke Greek.
To what effect?
Fare you well.
There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
No, I am promised forth.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
Good, I will expect you.
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.
And so it is.
For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you, or, if you will, Come home to me and I will wait for you.
I will do so.
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
And after this let Caesar seat him sure; For we will shake him, or worse days endure. 
Good even, Casca.
Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm?
Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction.
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
A common slave—you know him well by sight— Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand, Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides—I ha' not since put up my sword— Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glazed upon me and went surly by Without annoying me: and there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the market-place, Howling and shrieking.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say “These are their reasons; they are natural,” For, I believe, they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon.
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time; But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
He doth; for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
Good then, Casca.
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in.
Farewell, Cicero.
Who's there?
A Roman.
Casca, by your voice.
Your ear is good.
Cassius, what night is this!
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not.
You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, Why old men fool, and children calculate, Why all these things change from their ordinance, Their natures and preformed faculties, To monstrous quality, why, you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol, A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
Our fathers' minds are dead, And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits; Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land, In every place save here in Italy.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws.
What trash is Rome, What rubbish and what offal, when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar?
But, O grief, Where hast thou led me?
I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman; then I know My answer must be made.
Hold, my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence; And I do know, by this they stay for me In Pompey's Porch.
For now, this fearful night, There is no stir or walking in the streets, And the complexion of the element In favor's like the work we have in hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
To find out you.
Who's that?
Metellus Cimber?
No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts.
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
I am glad on't.
What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Am I not stay'd for?
Tell me.
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party— Be you content.
All this done, Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone To seek you at your house.
Well, I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
Three parts of him Is ours already, and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him. 
awake, I say!
what, Lucius!
Call'd you, my lord?
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
I will, my lord.
It must be by his death, and, for my part, I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking.
Crown him?
that; And then, I grant, we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections sway'd More than his reason.
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed.
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
I know not, sir.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
I will, sir.
The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them.
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress!” “Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!” Such instigations have been often dropp'd Where I have took them up.
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?
What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated To speak and strike?
O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
Tis good.
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you.
Is he alone?
No, sir, there are moe with him.
Do you know them?
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor.
O Conspiracy, Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, When evils are most free?
O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?
Seek none, conspiracy; Hide it in smiles and affability; For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
Know I these men that come along with you?
Yes, every man of them, and no man here But honors you, and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
He is welcome hither.
This, Decius Brutus.
He is welcome too.
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
They are all welcome.
Shall I entreat a word?
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?
No.
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the south, Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire, and the high east Stands as the Capitol, directly here.
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
And let us swear our resolution.
No, not an oath.
If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse— If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed; So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery.
But if these, As I am sure they do, bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress?
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter?
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath; when every drop of blood That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
But what of Cicero?
Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
Let us not leave him out.
No, by no means.
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands; Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity.
Then leave him out.
Indeed he is not fit.
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit, And not dismember Caesar!
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it!
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious, Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him, For he can do no more than Caesar's arm When Caesar's head is off.
Yet I fear him, For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar— Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness, and much company.
The clock hath stricken three.
Tis time to part.
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no, For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies, The unaccustom'd terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.
Never fear that.
Let me work; For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol.
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
By the eighth hour.
Is that the uttermost?
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons; Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
The morning comes upon's.
We'll leave you, Brutus, And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.
Fast asleep?
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber; Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, Which busy care draws in the brains of men; Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
Brutus, my lord!
Portia, what mean you?
Wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
Nor for yours neither.
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head, And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you.
So I did, Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor, Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep, And, could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail'd on your condition, I should not know you, Brutus.
Dear my lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
I am not well in health, and that is all.
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, He would embrace the means to come by it.
Why, so I do.
Good Portia, go to bed.
What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness?
No, my Brutus, You have some sick offense within your mind, Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of; and, upon my knees, I charm you, by my once commended beauty, By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one, That you unfold to me, yourself, your half, Why you are heavy, and what men tonight Have had resort to you; for here have been Some six or seven, who did hide their faces Even from darkness.
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you?
Am I yourself But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes?
Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure?
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose em.
I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh.
Can I bear that with patience And not my husband's secrets?
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Hark, hark, one knocks.
Portia, go in awhile, And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee, All the charactery of my sad brows.
Leave me with haste.
Lucius, who's that knocks?
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
By all the gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my sickness!
Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up My mortified spirit.
Now bid me run, And I will strive with things impossible, Yea, get the better of them.
What's to do?
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
That must we also.
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee, as we are going To whom it must be done.
Set on your foot, And with a heart new-fired I follow you, To do I know not what; but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on.
Follow me then. 
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out, “Help, ho!
My lord?
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success.
I will, my lord.
What mean you, Caesar?
Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.
There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets; And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead; Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds, In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast.
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not.
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today.
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.
And you are come in very happy time, To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decius.
Say he is sick.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
But, for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, 90 In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
And this way have you well expounded it.
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
And know it now, the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change.
Besides, it were a mock Apt to be render'd, for some one to say “Break up the Senate till another time, When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.” If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper “Lo, Caesar is afraid”?
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable.
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
Good morrow, Caesar.
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius, I have an hour's talk in store for you; Remember that you call on me today; Be near me, that I may remember you.
Caesar, I will.
And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me, And we like friends will straightway go together.
That every like is not the same, O Caesar, The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! 
Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark it well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.
If thou beest not immortal, look about you.
Security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend thee!
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate-house; Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?
To know my errand, madam.
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
I hear none, madam.
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray, And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
At mine own house, good lady.
What is't o'clock?
About the ninth hour, lady.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Madam, not yet.
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you.
Here the street is narrow, The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Come to me again, And bring me word what he doth say to thee. 
The ides of March are come.
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
Hail, Caesar!
Read this schedule.
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read, At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit That touches Caesar nearer.
Read it, great Caesar.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
What, is the fellow mad?
Sirrah, give place.
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
What enterprise, Popilius?
Fare you well.
What said Popilius Lena?
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
Look, how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself.
Cassius, be constant.
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him go, And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
He is address'd; press near and second him.
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
Are we all ready?
What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart.
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children.
Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw'd from the true quality With that which melteth fools, I mean sweet words, Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own, To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
What, Brutus?
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
Speak, hands, for me!
Then fall, Caesar!
Liberty!
Freedom!
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
And Cassius too.
Where's Publius?
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance— Talk not of standing.
Publius, good cheer, There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.
So tell them, Publius.
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.
Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers.
Where is Antony?
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday.
Fates, we will know your pleasures.
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time And drawing days out that men stand upon.
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
Grant that, and then is death a benefit; So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged His time of fearing death.
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey's basis lies along No worthier than the dust!
So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be call'd The men that gave their country liberty.
What, shall we forth?
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Soft, who comes here?
A friend of Antony's.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith.
So says my master Antony.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman; I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouch'd.
I'll fetch him presently.
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
O mighty Caesar!
Dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure?
If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.
O Antony, beg not your death of us!
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As, by our hands and this our present act, You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done.
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar.
For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony; Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers' temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities.
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you; Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand; Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus; Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours; Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all,—alas, what shall I say?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius!
Mark Antony,— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this: Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
I blame you not for praising Caesar so; But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends, Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.
You shall, Mark Antony.
Brutus, a word with you.
By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first, And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
What Antony shall speak, I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do't by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral.
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended.
Be it so, I do desire no more.
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
I do, Mark Antony.
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water.
Is thy master coming?
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet; Hie hence, and tell him so.
Yet stay awhile, Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the market-place.
There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand. 
I will hear Brutus speak.
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons, When severally we hear them rendered.
The noble Brutus is ascended.
Silence!
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!
Hear me for my cause, and be silent, that you may hear.
Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe.
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen?
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.
Who is here so base that would be a bondman?
If any, speak, for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?
If any, speak, for him have I offended.
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?
If any, speak, for him have I offended.
I pause for a reply.
None, Brutus, none.
Then none have I offended.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not?
With this I depart—that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Let him be Caesar.
Caesar's better parts Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
My countrymen— Peace!
Silence!
Brutus speaks.
Peace, ho!
Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony, By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
What does he say of Brutus?
He says, for Brutus' sake, He finds himself beholding to us all.
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Peace!
Let us hear what Antony can say.
You gentle Romans— Peace, ho!
Let us hear him.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men— Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse.
Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause; What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Mark'd ye his words?
He would not take the crown; Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.
Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar; I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.
Let but the commons hear this testament— Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read— And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.
We'll hear the will.
Read it, Mark Antony.
The will, the will!
We will hear Caesar's will.
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it!
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
Will you be patient?
Will you stay a while?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
They were traitors.
The testament!
They were villains, murderers.
The will!
Read the will!
You will compel me then to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend?
And will you give me leave?
You shall have leave.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle.
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on; 'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all; For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquish'd him.
Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey's statue, Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity.
These are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded?
Look you here, Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
O piteous spectacle!
O noble Caesar!
O woeful day!
O traitors, villains!
O most bloody sight!
Let not a traitor live!
Stay, countrymen.
Peace there!
Hear the noble Antony.
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
We'll mutiny.
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Away, then!
Come, seek the conspirators.
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
Peace, ho!
Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
O royal Caesar!
Hear me with patience.
Peace, ho!
Here was a Caesar!
When comes such another?
We'll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
Go fetch fire.
Pluck down benches.
Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
Now let it work.
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
And thither will I straight to visit him.
He comes upon a wish.
Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us any thing.
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Belike they had some notice of the people, How I had moved them.
Bring me to Octavius. 
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth.
What is your name?
Whither are you going?
Where do you dwell?
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Answer every man directly.
Ay, and briefly.
Ay, and wisely.
Ay, and truly, you were best.
What is my name?
Whither am I going?
Where do I dwell?
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
Proceed directly.
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
As a friend or an enemy?
As a friend.
That matter is answered directly.
For your dwelling, briefly.
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
Your name, sir, truly.
Truly, my name is Cinna.
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
Tear him, tear him!
Come, brands, ho, fire-.
Some to Decius' house, and some to Casca's, some to Ligarius'.
Away, go! 
These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
I do consent— Prick him down, Antony.
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house, Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies.
What, shall I find you here?
Or here, or at the Capitol.
This is a slight unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands.
Is it fit, The three-fold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it?
So you thought him, And took his voice who should be prick'd to die In our black sentence and proscription.
Octavius, I have seen more days than you, And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way; And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off, Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears And graze in commons.
You may do your will, But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
Do not talk of him But as a property.
And now, Octavius, Listen great things.
Let us do so, for we are at the stake, And bay'd about with many enemies; And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, Millions of mischiefs. 
Stand, ho!
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master.
Let me be resolved.
With courtesy and with respect enough, But not with such familiar instances, Nor with such free and friendly conference, As he hath used of old.
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.
Ever note, Lucilius, When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith; But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle; But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial.
Comes his army on?
March gently on to meet him.
Stand, ho!
Stand, ho!
Speak the word along.
Stand!
Stand!
Stand!
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Judge me, you gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs, And when you do them— Cassius, be content, Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.
Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground.
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this: You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side, Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.
I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Chastisement?
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What, shall one of us, That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, Than such a Roman.
Brutus, bait not me, I'll not endure it.
Go to, you are not, Cassius.
I am.
I say you are not.
Away, slight man!
Is't possible?
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
O gods, ye gods!
Must I endure all this?
All this?
Ay, more.
Must I bouge?
Must I observe you?
Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor?
By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen, Though it do split you, for, from this day forth, I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish.
Is it come to this?
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say “better”?
If you did, I care not.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.
I durst not?
No.
What, durst not tempt him?
For your life you durst not.
Do not presume too much upon my love; I may do that I shall be sorry for.
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am arm'd so strong in honesty, That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not.
I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means.
Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts, Dash him to pieces!
I denied you not.
You did.
I did not.
He was but a fool That brought my answer back.
Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
I do not, till you practise them on me.
You love me not.
I do not like your faults.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus.
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come, Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is aweary of the world: Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother; Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote, To cast into my teeth.
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know, When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
Sheathe your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope; Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb, That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again.
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
Do you confess so much?
Give me your hand.
And my heart too.
Have not you love enough to bear with me, When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful?
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth, When you are overearnest with your Brutus, He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet They be alone.
You shall not come to them.
Nothing but death shall stay me.
For shame, you generals!
What do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be; For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
Ha, ha!
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
Away, away, be gone!
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us.
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
I did not think you could have been so angry.
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
Of your philosophy you make no use, If you give place to accidental evils.
No man bears sorrow better.
Portia is dead.
Ha?
Portia?
She is dead.
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong: for with her death That tidings came: with this she fell distract, And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
And died so?
Even so.
O ye immortal gods!
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
Portia, art thou gone?
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
With what addition?
That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators.
Cicero one!
No, Messala.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
Nothing, Messala.
That, methinks, is strange.
Why ask you?
Hear you ought of her in yours?
No, my lord.
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
Why, farewell, Portia.
We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now.
Even so great men great losses should endure.
I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.
Well, to our work alive.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
I do not think it good.
Your reason?
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution.
The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged; From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.
Hear me, good brother.
Under your pardon.
There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures.
The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
No more.
Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night.
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.
Good night, good brother.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
Where is thy instrument?
Here in the tent.
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.
Call Claudius and some other of my men, I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Varro and Claudio!
Calls my lord?
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep; It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes a while, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
It does, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
It is my duty, sir.
I should not urge thy duty past thy might; I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
I have slept, my lord, already.
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again; I will not hold thee long.
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument; I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down Where I left reading?
Here it is, I think.
How ill this taper burns!
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition.
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil That makest my blood cold, and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
Why comest thou?
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well, then I shall see thee again?
Ay, at Philippi.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
Varro!
Claudius!
The strings, my lord, are false.
My lord?
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see any thing?
Nothing, my lord.
My lord?
My lord?
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
Did we, my lord?
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
Nor I, my lord.
It shall be done, my lord. 
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down, But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so.
Their battles are at hand; They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it.
They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage; But 'tis not so.
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show; Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
They stand, and would have parley.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth, the generals would have some words.
Stir not until the signal.
Words before blows.
Is it so, countrymen?
Not that we love words better, as you do.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, Crying “Long live!
Not stingless too.
O, yes, and soundless too, For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting.
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds, And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet; Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck.
Come, come, the cause.
If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands, Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
So I hope, I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor, Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
Old Cassius still!
If you dare fight today, come to the field; If not, when you have stomachs.
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
Ho, Lucilius!
Hark, a word with you.
My lord?
Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.
Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that, against my will, As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong, And his opinion.
Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us.
This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us, As we were sickly prey.
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
Believe not so.
I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.
Even so, Lucilius.
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly, that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you then determined to do?
Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself: I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life: arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below.
Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?
No, Cassius, no.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made.
For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed; If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
Why then, lead on.
O, that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come!
Away! 
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Let them all come down. 
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.
This ensign here of mine was turning back; I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly.
His soldiers fell to spoil, Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off; Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord; Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
This hill is far enough.
Look, look, Titinius: Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
They are, my lord.
Titinius, if thou lovest me, Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him, Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again, that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
I will be here again, even with a thought.
O my lord!
What news?
O, he lights too.
Come hither, sirrah.
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner, And then I swore thee, saving of thy life, That whatsoever I did bid thee do, Thou shouldst attempt it.
Come now, keep thine oath; Now be a freeman, and with this good sword, That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
Where did you leave him?
All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
He lies not like the living.
O my heart!
Is not that he?
Our day is gone; Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O error, soon conceived, Thou never comest unto a happy birth, But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
What, Pindarus!
Where art thou, Pindarus?
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears.
I may say “thrusting” it, For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.
Did I not meet thy friends?
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory, And bid me give it thee?
Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow; Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding.
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
Titinius' face is upward.
He is slain.
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.
Brave Titinius!
Look whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
What bastard doth not?
Who will go with me?
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I; Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius, And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.
Yield, or thou diest.
Only I yield to die.
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight: Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.
We must not.
A noble prisoner!
Room, ho!
Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
I'll tell the news.
Where is he?
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you, A prize no less in worth.
Keep this man safe, Give him all kindness; I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies.
Go on, And see whether Brutus be alive or dead, And bring us word unto Octavius' tent How every thing is chanced. 
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord, He came not back.
He is or ta'en or slain.
Sit thee down, Clitus.
Slaying is the word: It is a deed in fashion.
Hark thee, Clitus.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
Peace then, no words.
I'll rather kill myself.
Hark thee, Dardanius.
Shall I do such a deed?
O Dardanius!
O Clitus!
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
To kill him, Clitus.
Look, he meditates.
Now is that noble vessel full of grief, That it runs over even at his eyes.
Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
What says my lord?
I know my hour is come.
Not so, my lord.
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Good Volumnius, Thou know'st that we two went to school together; Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
I shall have glory by this losing day, More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life's history.
Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest That have but labor'd to attain this hour.
Fly, my lord, fly.
Hence!
Thou art a fellow of a good respect; Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face, While I do run upon it.
Wilt thou, Strato?
Give me your hand first.
Fare you well, my lord.
Farewell, good Strato.
What man is that?
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
Do so, good Messala.
How died my master, Strato?
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
Octavius, then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators, save only he, Did that they did in envy of great Caesar; He only, in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When the hurlyburly's done; When the battle's lost and won.
That will be ere the set of sun.
Where the place?
Upon the heath.
There to meet with Macbeth.
Paddock calls.
Anon!
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air. 
What bloody man is that?
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.
This is the sergeant, Who, like a good and hardy soldier fought ’Gainst my captivity.
Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it.
Doubtful it stood, As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art.
O valiant cousin!
Worthy gentleman!
As whence the sun ’gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come Discomfort swells.
Dismay'd not this Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes, As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorize another Golgotha, I cannot tell— But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.
Who comes here?
The worthy Thane of Ross.
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look That seems to speak things strange.
God save the King!
Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?
From Fife, great King, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold.
Great happiness!
That now Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition; Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch, Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest.
Go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth.
I'll see it done.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won. 
Where hast thou been, sister?
Killing swine.
Sister, where thou?
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap, And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd.
Give me,” quoth I.
Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries.
I'll give thee a wind.
Thou'rt kind.
And I another.
Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine; Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.
Show me, show me.
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
Peace!
The charm's wound up.
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
How far is't call'd to Forres?
What are these So wither'd, and so wild in their attire, That look not like the inhabitants o’ the earth, And yet are on't?
Live you?
or are you aught That man may question?
You seem to understand me, By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips.
You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so.
All hail, Macbeth!
hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
All hail, Macbeth!
hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair?
I’ the name of truth, Are ye fantastical or that indeed Which outwardly ye show?
My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal.
To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate.
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor?
The Thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be King Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor.
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence, or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting?
Speak, I charge you.
The earth hath bubbles as the water has, And these are of them.
Whither are they vanish'd?
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted As breath into the wind.
Would they had stay'd!
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be King.
To the selfsame tune and words.
Who's here?
Silenced with that, In viewing o'er the rest o’ the selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death.
As thick as hail Came post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense, And pour'd them down before him.
We are sent To give thee, from our royal master, thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee.
And for an earnest of a greater honor, He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane, For it is thine.
What, can the devil speak true?
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do you dress me In borrow'd robes?
Who was the Thane lives yet, But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose.
Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not; But treasons capital, confess'd and proved, Have overthrown him.
Aside.
The greatest is behind.
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them?
That, trusted Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the Thane of Cawdor.
Aside.
Aside.
This supernatural Cannot be ill, cannot be good.
If ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use of nature?
Look, how our partner's rapt.
Aside.
If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me Without my stir.
Aside.
Come what come may, [Aside.
Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Kind gentlemen, your pains Are register'd where every day I turn The leaf to read them.
Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time, The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak Our free hearts each to other.
Very gladly.
Till then, enough.
Come, friends. 
Is execution done on Cawdor?
Are not Those in commission yet return'd?
My liege, They are not yet come back.
But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons, Implored your highness’ pardon, and set forth A deep repentance.
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it; he died As one that had been studied in his death, To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me.
Thou art so far before, That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee.
Would thou hadst less deserved, That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine!
Only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay.
The service and the loyalty I owe, In doing it, pays itself.
Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor To make thee full of growing.
Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserved, nor must be known No less to have done so; let me enfold thee And hold thee to my heart.
There if I grow, The harvest is your own.
My plenteous joys, Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow.
From hence to Inverness, And bind us further to you.
My worthy Cawdor!
Aside.
That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, For in my way it lies.
True, worthy Banquo!
He is full so valiant, And in his commendations I am fed; It is a banquet to me.
Let's after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome: It is a peerless kinsman. 
They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o’ the milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way.
Thou wouldst be great; Art not without ambition, but without The illness should attend it.
The King comes here tonight.
Thou'rt mad to say it!
Is not thy master with him?
One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.
Give him tending; He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full Of direst cruelty!
Make thick my blood, Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between The effect and it!
Come to my woman's breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief!
Worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant.
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.
And when goes hence?
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
O, never Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters.
We will speak further.
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here.
No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle; Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed The air is delicate.
See, see, our honor'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love.
Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble.
All our service In every point twice done, and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house.
For those of old, And the late dignities heap'd up to them, We rest your hermits.
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor; but he rides well, And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us.
Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight.
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt, To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure, Still to return your own.
Give me your hand; Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly, And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess. 
If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well It were done quickly.
This even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips.
He has almost supp'd.
Why have you left the chamber?
Hath he ask'd for me?
Know you not he has?
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely?
From this time Such I account thy love.
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire?
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would” Like the poor cat i’ the adage?
Prithee, peace!
I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.
What beast was't then That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man; And, to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man.
Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both: They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you.
If we should fail?
We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we'll not fail.
When Duncan is asleep— Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince, That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason A limbec only.
What not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?
Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males.
Will it not be received, When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber, and used their very daggers, That they have done't?
How goes the night, boy?
And she goes down at twelve.
I take't ’tis later, sir.
Hold, take my sword.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose!
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
A friend.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The King's a-bed.
Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.
All's well.
At your kind'st leisure.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.
Good repose the while.
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses, Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before.
Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it.
Whiles I threat, he lives; Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
I go, and it is done: the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven, or to hell. 
Hark!
Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern'st good-night.
He is about it: The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.
Who's there?
what, ho!
The attempt and not the deed Confounds us.
Hark!
Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done't.
My husband!
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
When?
Now.
As I descended?
Ay.
Hark!
Who lies i’ the second chamber?
Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
There are two lodged together.
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?
I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat.
Me thought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more!
Why, worthy Thane, You do unbend your noble strength, to think So brainsickly of things.
Go, get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
Go carry them, and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red.
My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white.
Retire we to our chamber.
Your constancy Hath left you unattended.
Knock Knock Hark!
more knocking: Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers.
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.
To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself.
I would thou couldst! 
Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.
Knock Knock Knock, knock, knock, knock!
Who's there, i’ the name of Belzebub?
Here's a farmer that hanged himself on th’ expectation of plenty.
Knock Knock Knock, knock!
Who's there, in th’ other devil's name?
Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven.
O, come in, equivocator.
Knock Knock Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there?
Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose.
Come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.
Knock Knock Knock, knock!
Never at quiet!
What are you?
But this place is too cold for hell.
I'll devil-porter it no further.
I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.
Knock Knock Anon, anon!
I pray you, remember the porter.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me: but I requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.
Is thy master stirring?
Good morrow, noble sir.
Good morrow, both.
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
Not yet.
I'll bring you to him.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you; But yet ’tis one.
The labor we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
I'll make so bold to call, For ’tis my limited service.
Goes the King hence today?
The night has been unruly.
Twas a rough night.
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart Cannot conceive nor name thee.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
Most sacrilegious Murder hath broke ope The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence The life o’ the building.
What is't you say?
the life?
Mean you his Majesty?
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum bell.
Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, And look on death itself!
Up, up, and see The great doom's image!
Malcolm!
Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!
What's the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house?
Speak, speak!
O Banquo, Banquo!
Our royal master's murdered.
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.
What is amiss?
Your royal father's murdered.
O, by whom?
O, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.
Wherefore did you so?
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment?
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make's love known?
Help me hence, ho!
Look to the lady.
Why do we hold our tongues, That most may claim this argument for ours?
What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger-hole, may rush and seize us?
Nor our strong sorrow [Aside to Donalbain.
And so do I.
So all.
What will you do?
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer.
This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore to horse; And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, But shift away.
There's warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there's no mercy left. 
Ah, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act, Threaten his bloody stage.
Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that's done.
On Tuesday last A falcon towering in her pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
And Duncan's horses—a thing most strange and certain— Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind.
Tis said they eat each other.
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes That look'd upon't.
Here comes the good Macduff.
How goes the world, sir, now?
Why, see you not?
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?
Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up Thine own life's means!
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
He is already named, and gone to Scone To be invested.
Where is Duncan's body?
Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones.
Will you to Scone?
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
Well, I will thither.
Well, may you see things well done there, Adieu, Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
Farewell, father.
God's benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes! 
If there come truth from them— As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine— Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well And set me up in hope?
But hush, no more.
Here's our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast And all-thing unbecoming.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I'll request your presence.
Let your Highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit.
Ride you this afternoon?
Ay, my good lord.
We should have else desired your good advice, Which still hath been both grave and prosperous In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.
Is't far you ride?
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time ’Twixt this and supper.
Go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain.
Fail not our feast.
My lord, I will not.
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd In England and in Ireland, not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention.
But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly.
Goes Fleance with you?
Ay, my good lord.
Our time does call upon's.
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot, And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.
While then, God be with you!
Sirrah, a word with you.
Attend those men Our pleasure?
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear'd.
Tis much he dares, And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety.
If't be so, For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind, For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered, Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them, and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list, And champion me to the utterance!
Who's there?
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
It was, so please your Highness.
Well then, now Have you consider'd of my speeches?
Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self?
I did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting.
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature, That you can let this go?
Are you so gospell'd, To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave And beggar'd yours for ever?
We are men, my liege.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs.
I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
And I another So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on ’t.
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.
True, my lord.
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life: and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down.
And thence it is That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons.
We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.
Though our lives— Your spirits shine through you.
Resolve yourselves apart: I'll come to you anon.
We are resolved, my lord.
I'll call upon you straight.
Abide within.
It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight. 
Is Banquo gone from court?
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
Say to the King I would attend his leisure For a few words.
Madam, I will.
Nought's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content.
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
How now, my lord!
Why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on?
Things without all remedy Should be without regard.
What's done is done.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy.
Come on, Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
You must leave this.
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
Ere the bat hath flown His cloister'd flight; ere to black Hecate's summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.
What's to be done?
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale!
Thou marvell'st at my words, but hold thee still: Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me. 
But who did bid thee join with us?
Macbeth.
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do, To the direction just.
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day; Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn, and near approaches The subject of our watch.
Hark!
I hear horses.
Give us a light there, ho!
Then ’tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i’ the court.
His horses go about.
A light, a light!
Tis he.
Stand to't.
It will be rain tonight.
Let it come down.
O, treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge.
O slave!
Who did strike out the light?
We have lost best half of our affair.
Well, let's away and say how much is done. 
At first And last the hearty welcome.
Thanks to your Majesty.
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time We will require her welcome.
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart speaks they are welcome.
See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.
There's blood upon thy face.
Tis Banquo's then.
Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?
If thou didst it, Thou art the nonpareil.
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.
Ay, my good lord.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for the present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again.
My royal lord, You do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold That is not often vouch'd, while ’tis a-making, ’Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!
May't please your Highness sit.
ROSS: His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise.
Please't your Highness To grace us with your royal company?
The table's full.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
Where?
Here, my good lord.
What is't that moves your Highness?
Which of you have done this?
What, my good lord?
Pray you, keep seat.
The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well.
Are you a man?
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil.
O, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Authorized by her grandam.
Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces?
When all's done, You look but on a stool.
Prithee, see there!
Behold!
Look!
Lo!
How say you?
Why, what care I?
If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.
Fie, for shame!
This is more strange Than such a murder is.
My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.
I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me.
Come, love and health to all; Then I'll sit down.
Give me some wine, fill full.
I drink to the general joy o’ the whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here!
To all and him we thirst, And all to all.
Avaunt, and quit my sight!
Let the earth hide thee!
Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom.
What man dare, I dare.
Or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
Why, so: being gone, I am a man again.
Pray you, sit still.
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.
Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder?
You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine is blanch'd with fear.
ROSS: What sights, my lord?
At once, good night: Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once.
Good night, and better health Attend his Majesty!
A kind good night to all!
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak; Augures and understood relations have By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood.
What is the night?
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding?
Did you send to him, sir?
I hear it by the way, but I will send.
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd.
I will tomorrow, And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good All causes shall give way.
I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
Come, we'll to sleep.
We are yet but young in deed. 
Why, how now, Hecate?
You look angerly.
Have I not reason, beldams as you are, Saucy and overbold?
How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never call'd to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful: who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now.
Get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i’ the morning.
Thither he Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and every thing beside.
And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.
Music, and a song Music, and a song Hark!
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late, Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd, For Fleance fled.
Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father?
Damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth!
Did he not straight, In pious rage, the two delinquents tear, That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done?
Ay, and wisely too, For ’twould have anger'd any heart alive To hear the men deny't.
So that, I say, He has borne all things well; and I do think That, had he Duncan's sons under his key— As, an't please heaven, he shall not—they should find What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace!
For from broad words, and ’cause he fail'd His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace.
Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself?
The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect.
And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war.
Sent he to Macduff?
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed!
I'll send my prayers with him. 
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty-one Swelter'd venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot.
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake; Eye of newt and toe of frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog, Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, Lizard's leg and howlet's wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witch's mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, Root of hemlock digg'd i’ the dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat and slips of yew Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse, Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, Finger of birth-strangled babe Ditch-deliver'd by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron, For the ingredients of our cauldron.
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good.
O, well done!
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is't you do?
A deed without a name.
I conjure you, by that which you profess, Howe'er you come to know it, answer me: Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches, though the yeasty waves Confound and swallow navigation up, Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down, Though castles topple on their warders’ heads, Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure Of nature's germens tumble all together Even till destruction sicken, answer me To what I ask you.
Speak.
Demand.
We'll answer.
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, or from our masters?
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet throw Into the flame.
Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff; Beware the Thane of Fife.
Dismiss me.
Enough.
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; Thou hast harp'd my fear aright.
Here's another, More potent than the first.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
What need I fear of thee?
What is this, That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty?
Listen, but speak not to't.
That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earth-bound root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellion's head, rise never, till the Wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.
Seek to know no more.
I will be satisfied!
Deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you!
Show!
Show!
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo.
Down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this?
A fourth!
Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet!
A seventh!
Now I see ’tis true; For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, And points at them for his.
Ay, sir, all this is so.
But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, And show the best of our delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round, That this great King may kindly say Our duties did his welcome pay.
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!
What's your Grace's will?
Saw you the weird sisters?
No, my lord.
Came they not by you?
No indeed, my lord.
Infected be the air whereon they ride, And damn'd all those that trust them!
I did hear The galloping of horse.
Who was't came by?
Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.
Fled to England?
Ay, my good lord.
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.
Time, thou The flighty purpose never is o'ertook Unless the deed go with it.
From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand.
No boasting like a fool; This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
Come, bring me where they are. 
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
You must have patience, madam.
When our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors.
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Wisdom?
To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion, and his titles, in a place From whence himself does fly?
My dearest coz, I pray you, school yourself.
But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o’ the season.
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward To what they were before.
My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you!
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.
How will you live?
As birds do, Mother.
What, with worms and flies?
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
Poor bird!
Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, The pitfall nor the gin.
Why should I, Mother?
Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
Yes, he is dead.
How wilt thou do for a father?
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Then you'll buy ’em to sell again.
Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i’ faith, With wit enough for thee.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
Ay, that he was.
What is a traitor?
Why, one that swears and lies.
And be all traitors that do so?
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Every one.
Who must hang them?
Why, the honest men.
Then the liars and swearers are fools; for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them.
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt thou do for a father?
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
Bless you, fair dame!
I am not to you known, Though, in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man's advice, Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm.
But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly.
Where is your husband?
I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him.
He's a traitor.
Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!
What, you egg!
Young fry of treachery!
He has kill'd me, Mother.
Run away, I pray you! 
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom.
Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolor.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest.
You have loved him well; He hath not touch'd you yet.
I am young, but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb To appease an angry god.
I am not treacherous.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so.
I have lost my hopes.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?
I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonors, But mine own safeties.
You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee.
Wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer'd.
Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp And the rich East to boot.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds.
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands.
But for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed.
What should he be?
It is myself I mean, in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compared With my confineless harms.
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd In evils to top Macbeth.
I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name.
But there's no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness.
Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will.
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign.
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours.
You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclined.
With this there grows In my most ill-composed affection such A stanchless avarice that, were I King, I should cut off the nobles for their lands, Desire his jewels and this other's house, And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more, that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth.
This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings.
Yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will Of your mere own.
All these are portable, With other graces weigh'd.
But I have none.
The king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them, but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways.
Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth.
O Scotland, Scotland!
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.
Thy royal father Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived.
Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banish'd me from Scotland.
O my breast, Thy hope ends here!
Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From over-credulous haste.
But God above Deal between thee and me!
For even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature.
I am yet Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, At no time broke my faith, would not betray The devil to his fellow, and delight No less in truth than life.
My first false speaking Was this upon myself.
What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country's to command: Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel!
Why are you silent?
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’Tis hard to reconcile.
Well, more anon.
Comes the King forth, I pray you?
I thank you, Doctor.
What's the disease he means?
Tis call'd the evil: A most miraculous work in this good King, Which often, since my here-remain in England, I have seen him do.
With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, And sundry blessings hang about his throne That speak him full of grace.
See, who comes here?
My countryman: but yet I know him not.
My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.
I know him now.
Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers!
Sir, amen.
Stands Scotland where it did?
Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself!
It cannot Be call'd our mother, but our grave.
Where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air, Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy.
The dead man's knell Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken.
O, relation Too nice, and yet too true!
What's the newest grief?
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker; Each minute teems a new one.
How does my wife?
Why, well.
And all my children?
Well too.
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.
Be't their comfort We are coming thither.
Would I could answer This comfort with the like!
But I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them.
What concern they?
The general cause?
Or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast?
No mind that's honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter'd.
To relate the manner Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer, To add the death of you.
Merciful heaven!
What, man!
Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; Give sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er fraught heart, and bids it break.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants, all That could be found.
And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?
I have said.
Be comforted.
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did you say all?
O hell-kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop?
Dispute it like a man.
I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me.
Did heaven look on, And would not take their part?
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!
Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now!
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes, And braggart with my tongue!
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the King; our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments.
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching!
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should.
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.
Lo you, here she comes!
This is her very guise, and, upon my life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.
How came she by that light?
Why, it stood by her.
She has light by her continually; ’tis her command.
You see, her eyes are open.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
What is it she does now?
Look how she rubs her hands.
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands.
I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
Yet here's a spot.
Hark, she speaks!
I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
Out, damned spot!
Out, I say!
One–two— why then ’tis time to do't.
Hell is murky.
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier, and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
Do you mark that?
The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that.
You mar all with this starting.
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
Here's the smell of the blood still.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, oh, oh!
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
Well, well, well— Pray God it be, sir.
This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave.
Even so?
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.
What's done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed.
Will she go now to bed?
Directly.
Foul whisperings are abroad.
God, God, forgive us all!
Good night, good doctor. 
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man.
Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
There is Siward's son And many unrough youths, that even now Protest their first of manhood.
What does the tyrant?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief.
Who then shall blame His pester'd senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?
Well, march we on, To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, And with him pour we, in our country's purge, Each drop of us.
Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam 
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?
Soldiers, sir.
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver'd boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul!
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
The English force, so please you.
Take thy face hence.
Seyton—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
My way of life Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf, And that which should accompany old age, As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.
Seyton!
What's your gracious pleasure?
What news more?
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
I'll fight, ’til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armor.
Tis not needed yet.
I'll put it on.
Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies, That keep her from her rest.
Cure her of that.
Therein the patient Must minister to himself.
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
Seyton, send out.
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch.
If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.
Pull't off, I say.
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug Would scour these English hence?
Hear'st thou of them?
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.
We doubt it nothing.
What wood is this before us?
The Wood of Birnam.
It shall be done.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before't.
Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate; Towards which, advance the war. 
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.
What is that noise?
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
Wherefore was that cry?
The Queen, my lord, is dead.
Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more.
It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do it.
Well, say, sir.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought, The Wood began to move.
Liar and slave!
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.
I pull in resolution and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth.
Fear not, till Birnam Wood Do come to Dunsinane,” and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.
Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I ’gin to be aweary of the sun And wish the estate o’ the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum bell!
Blow, wind!
Come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back. 
Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down, And show like those you are.
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight, Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
What's he That was not born of woman?
Such a one Am I to fear, or none.
What is thy name?
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
My name's Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.
No, nor more fearful.
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
That way the noise is.
Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine, My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight, The noble thanes do bravely in the war; The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do.
We have met with foes That strike beside us.
Enter, sir, the castle. 
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword?
Whiles I see lives, the gashes Do better upon them.
Turn, hell hound, turn!
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
Thou losest labor.
Despair thy charm, And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb Untimely ripp'd.
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed, That palter with us in a double sense, That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope.
I'll not fight with thee.
Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o’ the time.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last.
Before my body I throw my warlike shield!
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
Then he is dead?
Ay, and brought off the field.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.
Had he his hurts before?
Ay, on the front.
Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death.
And so his knell is knoll'd.
Here comes newer comfort.
Behold where stands The usurper's cursed head.
The time is free.
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl That speak my salutation in their minds, Whose voices I desire aloud with mine: Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, King of Scotland!
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you.
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad; It wearies me; you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn; And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself.
Your mind is tossing on the ocean; There, where your argosies, with portly sail,— Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,— Do overpeer the petty traffickers, That curt'sy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings.
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad.
I should be still Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind; Peering in maps, for ports, and piers, and roads: And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad.
My wind, cooling my broth, Would blow me to an ague, when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run, But I should think of shallows and of flats; And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand, Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs, To kiss her burial.
Should I go to church, And see the holy edifice of stone, And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel's side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing?
Shall I have the thought To think on this; and shall I lack the thought That such a thing, bechanc'd, would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year: Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
Not in love neither?
Then let us say, you are sad, Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy For you to laugh, and leap, and say you are merry, Because you are not sad.
Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh, like parrots, at a bag-piper; And other of such vinegar aspect, That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me.
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you, And you embrace the occasion to depart.
Good morrow, my good lords.
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?
say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you; but at dinner-time, I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
I will not fail you.
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano; A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one.
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.
Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
Thanks, i' faith; for silence is only commendable In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.
Is that any thing now?
Well; tell me now, what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate, By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance: Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd From such a noble rate; but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag'd.
To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love; And from your love I have a warranty To unburthen all my plots and purposes, How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; And, if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honour, be assur'd, My purse, my person, my extremest means, Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
In my schooldays, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch, To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof, Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost: but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
You know me well, and herein spend but time, To wind about my love with circumstance; And, out of doubt, you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost, Than if you had made waste of all I have.
Then do but say to me what I should do, That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it: therefore speak.
In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth; For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece; Which makes her seat of Belmont, Colchos' strand, And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O, my Antonio!
had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift, That I should questionless be fortunate.
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money, nor commodity To raise a present sum: therefore go forth, Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is; and I no question make, To have it of my trust, or for my sake. 
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great world.
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with nothing.
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean; superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.
Good sentences, and well pronounced.
They would be better, if well followed.
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions: I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.
The brain may devise laws for the blood; but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple.
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband:—O me, the word choose!
Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead, (whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,) will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly, but one who you shall rightly love.
But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
Ay, that's a colt, indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself: I am much afraid my lady his mother played false with a smith.
Then, is there the county Palatine.
He doth nothing but frown; as who should say, An you will not have me, choose; he hears merry tales, and smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.
I had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth, than to either of these.
God defend me from these two!
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker; but, he!
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
You know I say nothing to him; for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will come into the court, and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour everywhere.
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him; for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able: I think the Frenchman became his surety, and sealed under for another.
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober; and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man; and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast: and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should refuse to accept him.
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for, if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it.
I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords: they have acquainted me with their determinations: which is, indeed, to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit; unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition, depending on the caskets.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will.
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he called.
True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
I remember him well; and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
How now!
what news?
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco; who brings word, the prince, his master, will be here to-night.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach: if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa.
Three thousand ducats,—well.
Ay, sir, for three months.
For three months,—well.
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
Antonio shall become bound,—well.
May you stead me?
Will you pleasure me?
Shall I know your answer?
Three thousand ducats, for three months, and Antonio bound.
Your answer to that.
Antonio is a good man.
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
But ships are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats and water-rats, land-thieves and water-thieves; I mean, pirates; and then, there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.
The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient;—three thousand ducats; —I think I may take his bond.
Be assured you may.
I will be assured I may; and that I may be assured, I will bethink me.
May I speak with Antonio?
If it please you to dine with us.
Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into!
This is Signior Antonio.
How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian: But more, for that, in low simplicity, He lends out money gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation; and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest.
Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him!
Shylock, do you hear?
I am debating of my present store: And, by the near guess of my memory, I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats.
What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow, By taking, nor by giving of excess, Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I'll break a custom:—Is he yet possess'd How much you would?
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
And for three months.
Well then, your bond; and, let me see.
but hear you: Methought you said, you neither lend nor borrow, Upon advantage.
I do never use it.
did he take interest?
No, not take interest; not, as you would say, Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromis'd That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied Should fall, as Jacob's hire; the ewes, being rank, In the end of autumn turned to the rams: And when the work of generation was, Between these woolly breeders, in the act, The skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands, And, in the doing of the deed of kind, He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes; Who, then conceiving, did in eaning-time Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for; A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of Heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast: But note me, signior.
Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek; A goodly apple rotten at the heart; O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
Three thousand ducats;—'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve, then let me see; the rate.
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholden to you?
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft, In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys, and my usances: Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe: You call me,—misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine, And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help: Go to then: you come to me, and you say, Shylock, we would have monies; you say so; You, that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me, as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold; monies is your suit.
What should I say to you?
Should I not say, Hath a dog money?
Why, look you, how you storm!
This were kindness.
Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me; I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it; Within these two months,—that's a month before This bond expires,—I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others!
Pray you, tell me this; If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.
I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship; If he will take it, so; if not, adieu; And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's; Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight; See to my house, left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave; and presently I will be with you.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
Come on; in this there can be no dismay, My ships come home a month before the day. 
Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun, To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love, To prove whose blood is reddest, his, or mine.
In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden's eyes: Besides, the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing: But, if my father had not scanted me, And hedg'd me by his wit, to yield myself His wife, who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have look'd on yet, For my affection.
Even for that I thank you; Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets, To try my fortune.
By this scimitar,— That slew the Sophy, and a Persian prince, That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,— I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady.
But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: So is Alcides beaten by his page; And so may I, blind fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with grieving.
You must take your chance; And either not attempt to choose at all, Or swear, before you choose,—if you choose wrong, Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.
First, forward to the temple; after dinner Your hazard shall be made.
To make me bless'd, or cursed'st among men. 
Certainly, my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.
The fiend is at mine elbow, and tempts me; saying to me,—Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot, or good Gobbo, or good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.—My conscience says, no; take heed, honest Launcelot; take heed, honest Gobbo; or, (as aforesaid) honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run: scorn running with thy heels: well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack; Via!
says the fiend; away!
Master, young man, you; I pray you, which is the way to master Jew's?
O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
Master, young gentleman, I pray you which is the way to master Jew's?
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit.
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him, or no?
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?—Mark me now—now will I raise the waters.—Talk you of young master Launcelot?
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father, though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live.
Well, let his father be what a will, we talk of young master Launcelot.
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
But I pray you ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young master Launcelot.
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
Marry, God forbid!
the boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
Do I look like a cudgel, or a hovel-post, a staff, or a prop?
Do you know me, father?
Do you not know me, father?
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child.
Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.
I cannot think you are my son.
I know not what I shall think of that: but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man; and I am sure Margery, your wife, is my mother.
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my phill-horse has on his tail.
It should seem then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail, than I have of my face, when I last saw him.
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I have brought him a present.
How 'gree you now?
Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
My master's a very Jew.
give him a halter: I am famished in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs.
here comes the man;—to him, father; for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.
You may do so:—but let it be so hasted, that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.
See these letters delivered; put the liveries to making; and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
To him, father.
God bless your worship!
wouldst thou aught with me?
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,— Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that would, sir, as my father shall specify,— He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve,— Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify,— His master and he (saving your worship's reverence) are scarce cater-cousins:— To be brief, the very truth is, that the Jew having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you, — I have here a dish of doves, that I would bestow upon your worship; and my suit is,— In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say it, though old man, yet, poor man, my father.
One speak for both:—what would you?
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir; you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.
Thou speak'st it well.
If any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune!
here's a small trifle of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing; aleven widows and nine maids, is a simple coming-in for one man: and then, to 'scape drowning thrice; and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed; here are simple 'scapes!
Well, if fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear.—Father, come.
I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
My best endeavours shall be done herein.
Where's your master?
Yonder, sir, he walks.
Signior Bassanio,— Gratiano!
I have a suit to you.
You have obtain'd it.
Signior Bassanio, hear me: If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely; Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say Amen; Use all the observance of civility, Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam,—never trust me more.
Well, we shall see your bearing.
Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gage me By what we do to-night.
No, that were pity; I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment.
But fare you well, I have some business.
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest; But we will visit you at supper-time. 
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so; Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness: But fare thee well: there is a ducat for thee.
Adieu!—tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan,—most sweet Jew!
If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
But, adieu!
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit: adieu!
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me, To be asham'd to be my father's child!
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife; Become a Christian, and thy loving wife. 
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return, All in an hour.
We have not made good preparation.
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered, And better, in my mind, not undertook.
An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand; And whiter than the paper it writ on, Is the fair hand that writ.
Love-news, in faith.
By your leave, sir.
Whither goest thou?
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
I am provided of a torch-bearer.
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
And so will I.
Meet me and Gratiano, At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
Tis good we do so.
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
I must needs tell thee all.
She hath directed How I shall take her from her father's house; What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with; What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter's sake: And never dare misfortune cross her foot, Unless she do it under this excuse,— That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest: Fair Jessica shall be my torchbearer. 
Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight; The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath, And comes to his election presently.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince; If you choose that wherein I am contain'd, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd; But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to any one, Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you, and be gone.
To these injunctions every one doth swear, That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
What says the golden chest?
ha!
let me see: Who chooseth me, shall gain what many men desire.
What many men desire.—that many may be meant By the fool multitude, that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; Which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet, Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits, And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
and that clear honour Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!
Well, but to my choice: Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserves.
I will assume desert:—Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
Too long a pause for that which you find there.
What's here?
the portrait of a blinking idiot, Presenting me a schedule!
I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
Is that my prize?
are my deserts no better?
To offend, and judge, are distinct offices, And of opposed natures.
What is here?
Sweet, adieu!
I'll keep my oath, Patiently to bear my wroth.
Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
O these deliberate fools!
when they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
Where is my lady?
Here; what would my lord?
No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard, Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be. 
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:— What, Jessica!—thou shalt not gormandise, As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!— And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out;— Why, Jessica, I say!
Why, Jessica!
Who bids thee call?
I do not bid thee call.
Your worship was wont to tell me, I could do nothing without bidding.
Call you?
What is your will?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me: But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.—I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your reproach.
So do I, his.
And they have conspired together,—I will not say, you shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black- Monday last, at six o'clock i' the morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in the afternoon.
What!
are there masques?
Hear you me, Jessica: Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum, And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street, To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces: But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements; Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house.—By Jacob's staff I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth to-night: But I will go.—Go you before me, sirrah; Say, I will come.
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring; ha?
His words were, Farewell mistress; nothing else.
Farewell; and if my fortune be not cross'd, I have a father, you a daughter, lost. 
This is the pent-house, under which Lorenzo Desir'd us to make stand.
His hour is almost past.
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again, His tedious measures with the unbated fire, That he did pace them first?
All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
How like a younger, or a prodigal, The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like a prodigal doth she return; With over-weather'd ribs, and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
Here comes Lorenzo;—more of this hereafter.
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode: Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait: When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I'll watch as long for you then.—Approach; Here dwells my father Jew.—Ho!
who's within?
Who are you?
Tell me, for more certainty, Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
Lorenzo, and thy love.
Lorenzo, certain; and my love, indeed; For who love I so much?
And now, who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
Heaven, and thy thoughts, are witness that thou art.
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me, For I am much asham'd of my exchange: But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit; For if they could, Cupid himself would blush, To see me thus transformed to a boy.
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too-too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love; And I should be obscur'd.
So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once; For the close night doth play the run-away, And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
Beshrew me, but I love her heartily: For she is wise, if I can judge of her; And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true; And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself; And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
Who's there?
Signior Antonio!
where are all the rest?
I am glad on't; I desire no more delight, Than to be under sail and gone to-night. 
The one of them contains my picture, prince; If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
Some god direct my judgment!
Let me see.
for lead?
hazard for lead?
This casket threatens: Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross; I'll then nor give, nor hazard, aught for lead.
What says the silver, with her virgin hue?
Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserves.
What if I strayed no further, but chose here?— Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold: Who chooseth me, shall gain what many men desire.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her?
Twere damnation To think so base a thought: it were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd, Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought!
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold.
There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there, Then I am yours.
He unlocks the golden casket] [He unlocks the golden casket] O hell!
what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll?
I'll read the writing.
All that glisters is not gold, Often have you heard that told: Many a man his life hath sold, But my outside to behold: Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail; With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship, I am sure, Lorenzo is not.
the law!
my ducats, and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!
find the girl!
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear; Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part: Bassanio told him, he would make some speed Of his return; he answer'd—Do not so, Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio, But stay the very riping of the time; And for the Jew's bond, which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love: Be merry; and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship, and such fair ostents of love, As shall conveniently become you there: And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And, with affection wondrous sensible, He wrung Bassanio's hand, and so they parted.
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out, And quicken his embraced heaviness, With some delight or other.
Do we so. 
Now, what news on the Rialto?
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack'd on the narrow seas,—the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip report, be an honest woman of her word.
I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as ever knapped ginger, or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
But it is true,—without any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plain highway of talk,—that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!— Come, the full stop.
I would it might prove the end of his losses!
what news among the merchants?
You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's flight.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
She is damn'd for it.
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
Out upon it, old carrion!
rebels it at these years?
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge.
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
if you poison us, do we not die?
and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
revenge.
If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example?
why, revenge.
The villany you teach me I will execute; and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both.
We have been up and down to seek him.
Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
hast thou found my daughter?
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
Why, there, there, there, there!
a diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort!
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin!
Why, thou loss upon loss!
the thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge: nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my breathing: no tears but o' my shedding.
Yes, other men have ill luck too.
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa,— What, what, what?
ill luck, ill luck?
Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
is it true?
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.
ha!—Where?
in Genoa?
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats!
fourscore ducats!
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture Him; I am glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring, that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
Out upon her!
Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise: I had it of Leah, when I was a bachelor: I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
But Antonio is certainly undone.
Nay, that's true, that's very true.
Go, Tubal, fee me an officer, bespeak him a fortnight before: I will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; forwere he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I will.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal. 
I could teach you How to choose right, but then I am forsworn; So will I never be: so may you miss me; But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn.
Beshrew your eyes, They have o'erlook'd me, and divided me; One half of me is yours, the other half yours,— Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, And so, all yours: O!
Let me choose; For, as I am, I live upon the rack.
Upon the rack, Bassanio?
then confess What treason there is mingled with your love.
None, but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love: There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack, Where men enforced do speak anything.
Well, then, confess, and live.
Confess, and love, Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
He may win; And what is music then?
Then music is Even as the flourish, when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch: such it is, As are those dulcet sounds in break of day, That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear, And summon him to marriage.
Now he goes, With no less presence, but with much more love, Than young Alcides, when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice, The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With bleared visages, come forth to view The issue of the exploit.
Go, Hercules!
Tell me where is fancy bred, Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished?
Ding, dong, bell.
So may the outward shows be least themselves; The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt, But, being season'd with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil?
In religion, What damned error, but some sober brow Will bless it, and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple, but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest.
How all the other passions fleet to air, As, doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair, And shudd'ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy.
O Love, be moderate.
What find I here?
Fair Portia's counterfeit?
What demi-god Hath come so near creation?
Move these eyes?
Here in her hairs, The painter plays the spider; and hath woven A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men, Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes,— How could he see to do them?
You that choose not by the view, Chance as fair, and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content, and seek no new.
If you be well pleas'd with this, And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll.—Fair lady, by your leave: I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize, That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no; So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so; As doubtful whether what I see be true, Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
Madam, you have bereft me of all words; Only my blood speaks to you in my veins, And there is such confusion in my powers, As, after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince, there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude; Where every something, being blent together, Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy, Express'd and not express'd.
But when this ring Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence; O, then be bold to say, Bassanio's dead.
My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by, and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, good joy; Good joy, my lord and lady!
My lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish; For I am sure you can wish none from me: And, when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you, Even at that time I may be married too.
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls: For wooing here, until I sweat again, And swearing until my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last,—if promise last,— I got a promise of this fair one here, To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev'd her mistress.
Is this true, Nerissa?
Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
Yes faith, my lord.
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
We'll play with them, the first boy for a thousand ducats.
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
But who comes here?
Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio?
So do I, my lord.
They are entirely welcome.
I thank your honour.—For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here; But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along.
I did, my lord, And I have reason for it.
Signior Antonio Commends him to you.
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind; Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there Will show you his estate.
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio.
What's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success; We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost!
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper, That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek; Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man.
When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed, I have engag'd myself to a dear friend, Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy, To feed my means.
Here is a letter, lady; The paper as the body of my friend, And every word in it a gaping wound, Issuing life-blood.
But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd?
What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks?
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear, that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it.
When I was with him, I have heard him swear To Tubal, and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio's flesh, Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him; and I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio.
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies; and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears, Than any that draws breath in Italy.
What sum owes he the Jew?
For me, three thousand ducats.
What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond; Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church, and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend; For never shall you lie by Portia's side With an unquiet soul.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all Reads] miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but see you at my death; Notwithstanding, use your pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste: but, till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain. 
Gaoler, look to him.
tell not me of mercy;— This is the fool that lent out money gratis;— Gaoler, look to him.
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
I pray thee, hear me speak.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-ey'd fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.
Follow not; I'll have no speaking; I will have my bond.
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.
Let him alone; I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
I am sure, the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
The Duke cannot deny the course of law, For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice; if it be denied, 'Twill much impeach the justice of the state; Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations.
Therefore, go These griefs and losses have so 'bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh To-morrow, to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on:—Pray God, Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not! 
Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of god-like amity; which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But, if you knew to whom you show this honour, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work, Than customary bounty can enforce you.
I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together, Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit; Which makes me think, that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord.
If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestow'd, In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty!
This comes too near the praising of myself, Therefore, no more of it: hear other things.
I do desire you Not to deny this imposition, The which my love, and some necessity, Now lays upon you.
Madam, with all my heart, I shall obey you in all fair commands.
My people do already know my mind, And will acknowledge you and Jessica, In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well, till we shall meet again.
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand, That you yet know not of; we'll see our husbands Before they think of us.
Shall they see us?
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit, That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack.
Why, shall we turn to men?
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate; and therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles to-day. 
Yes, truly;—for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you I fear you.
I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: therefore, be of good chee; for, truly, I think you are damned.
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed; so, the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are gone both ways.
I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a Christian.
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he comes.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth, than you can the getting up of the negro's belly; the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
It is much, that the Moor should be more than reason: but if she be less than an honest woman, she is, indeed more than I took her for.
How every fool can play upon the word!
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!
then bid them prepare dinner.
That is done too, sir: only, cover is the word.
Will you cover, then, sir?
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
Yet more quarrelling with occasion!
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
I pray thee, understand a plain man in his plain meaning; go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming into dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words; and I do know A many fools, that stand in better place, Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word Defy the matter.
How cheer'st thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion;— How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
Past all expressing.
It is very meet, The Lord Bassanio live an upright life; For, having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; And, if on earth he do not mean it, then In reason he should never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawn'd with the other; for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.
Even such a husband Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife.
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
I will anon; first, let us go to dinner.
Nay, let me praise you, while I have a stomach.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk; Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things I shall digest it.
Well, I'll set you forth. 
What, is Antonio here?
Ready, so please your grace.
I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury; and am arm'd To suffer, with a quietness of spirit, The very tyranny and rage of his.
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty: And where thou now exact'st the penalty, (Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,) Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, But, touch'd with human gentleness and love, Forgive a moiety of the principal; Glancing an eye of pity on his losses, That have of late so huddled on his back, Enough to press a royal merchant down, And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms, and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that: But, say, it is my humour.
What, if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban'd?
What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose, Cannot contain their urine: for affection, Master of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes, or loathes.
Are you answer'd?
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Every offence is not a hate at first.
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, I would not draw them,—I would have my bond.
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season'd with such viands?
Upon my power, I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here to-day.
My lord, here stays without, A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua.
Good cheer, Antonio!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
Came you, from Padua, from Bellario?
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can, No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith, To hold opinion with Pythagoras, That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam, Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires Are wolvish, bloody, sterved, and ravenous.
He attendeth here hard by, To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
Come you from old Bellario?
I did, my lord.
You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court?
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
Is your name Shylock?
Shylock is my name.
Ay, so he says.
Do you confess the bond?
I do.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
On what compulsion must I?
tell me that.
Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this— That in the course of justice, none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; And that same prayer, doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.
I have spoke thus much, To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
My deeds upon my head!
I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
Is he not able to discharge the money?
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court; Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart: If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth.
And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority: To do a great right, do a little wrong; And curb this cruel devil of his will.
A Daniel come to judgment!
yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
Here, 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
No, not for Venice.
When it is paid according to the tenor.
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.
Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
O noble judge!
O excellent young man!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
It is so.
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh?
I have them ready.
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
It is not so express'd, but what of that?
Twere good you do so much for charity.
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
Come, merchant, have you any thing to say?
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you; For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use, To let the wretched man out-live his wealth, To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow, An age of poverty; from which lingering penance Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife: Tell her the process of Antonio's end, Say, how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death; And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend, And he repents not that he pays your debt; For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Antonio, I am married to a wife, Which is as dear to me as life itself; But life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteem'd above thy life; I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that, If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
I have a wife, whom I protest I love; I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
Tis well you offer it behind her back; The wish would make else an unquiet house.
We trifle time; I pray thee pursue sentence.
Most rightful judge!
come, prepare!
Is that the law?
Thyself shalt see the act: For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
I take this offer then,—pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.
Here is the money.
O Jew!
an upright judge, a learned judge!
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor more, But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more, Or less, than a just pound,—be it but so much As makes it light, or heavy, in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple,—nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair,— Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.
Why doth the Jew pause?
take thy forfeiture.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
I have it ready for thee; here it is.
He hath refus'd it in the open court; He shall have merely justice and his bond.
Shall I not have barely my principal?
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture, To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,— If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive, Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state; And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st: For it appears by manifest proceeding, That, indirectly, and directly too, Thou hast contriv'd against the very life Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself: And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord; Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that: You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life, When you do take the means whereby I live.
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
So please my lord the duke, and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods; I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use, to render it, Upon his death, unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter; Two things provided more,—that for this favour, He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift, Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd, Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
He shall do this; or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here.
Art thou contented, Jew?
what dost thou say?
I am content.
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
I pray you give me leave to go from hence: I am not well; send the deed after me, And I will sign it.
Get thee gone, but do it.
In christening, shalt thou have two god-fathers; Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
Most worthy gentleman, I, and my friend, Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof, Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
And stand indebted, over and above, In love and service to you evermore.
He is well paid that is well satisfied: And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid; My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me, when we meet again; I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
I will have nothing else but only this; And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.
There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation; Only for this I pray you pardon me.
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers: You taught me first to beg; and now, methinks, You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife; And, when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad woman, And know how well I have deserv'd the ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever, For giving it to me.
Well, peace be with you!
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring, Let his deservings, and my love withal, Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; Give him the ring; and bring him, if thou canst, Unto Antonio's house:—away!
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it; we'll away to-night, And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en: My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner.
That cannot be: His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore, I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
That will I do.
Thou may'st, I warrant we shall have old swearing, That they did give the rings away to men; But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
Away!
make haste; thou know'st where I will tarry.
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house? 
The moon shines bright:—in such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, And they did make no noise,—in such a night, Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls, And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, Where Cressid lay that night.
In such a night, Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew, And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, And ran dismay'd away.
In such a night, Stood Dido, with a willow in her hand, Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage.
In such a night, Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson.
In such a night, Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice, As far as Belmont.
In such a night, Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well; Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne'er a true one.
In such a night, Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
I would out-night you, did no body come; But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
A friend.
A friend?
what friend?
your name, I pray you, friend?
Stephano is my name; and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours.
Who comes with her?
None, but a holy hermit, and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
Sola, sola!
wo ha, ho!
sola, sola!
Who calls?
Sola!
sola, sola!
Sola!
Where?
where?
Here.
Tell him there's a post come from my master, with his horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand: And bring your music forth into the air.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears; soft stillness, and the night, Become the touches of sweet harmony.
and wake Diana with a hymn; With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music.
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus: Let no such man be trusted.—Mark the music.
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
So doth the greater glory dim the less: A substitute shines brightly as a king, Unto the king be by; and then his state, Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters.
Music!
hark!
It is your music, madam, of the house.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect; Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark, When neither is attended; and, I think, The nightingale, if she should sing by day, When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren.
the moon sleeps with Endymion, And would not be awak'd.
That is the voice, Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?
Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before, To signify their coming.
Go in, Nerissa; Give order to my servants, that they take No note at all of our being absent hence; Nor you, Lorenzo:—Jessica, nor you.
We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun.
I thank you, madam: Give welcome to my friend.— This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.
No more than I am well acquitted of.
A quarrel, ho, already!
what's the matter?
You swore to me, when I did give it you, That you would wear it till your hour of death; And that it should lie with you in your grave: Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective, and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk!—no, God's my judge!
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
He will, an if he live to be a man.
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,— A kind of boy; a little scrubbed boy, No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk; A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee; I could not for my heart deny it him.
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife's first gift; A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger, And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it; and here he stands,— I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it, Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth That the world masters.
Now, in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief; An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it, and, indeed, Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine: And neither man, nor master, would take aught But the two rings.
What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me.
If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it; but you see, my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.
Nor I in yours Till I again see mine.
Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe; I'll die for't, but some woman had the ring.
No, by mine honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him, And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away; Even he that had uphold the very life Of my dear friend.
What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforc'd to send it after him; I was beset with shame and courtesy; My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it.
Pardon me, good lady; For, by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there, I think, you would have begg'd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd How you do leave me to mine own protection.
Well, do you so: let not me take him then, For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong; And, in the hearing of these many friends, I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, Wherein I see myself,— Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself: In each eye, one:—swear by your double self, And there's an oath of credit.
Nay, but hear me: Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear, I never more will break an oath with thee.
Then you shall be his surety.
Give him this And bid him keep it better than the other.
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio: For by this ring the doctor lay with me.
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano; For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
are we cuckolds, ere we have deserv'd it?
I am dumb.
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he live until he be a man.
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow; When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
Sweet lady, you have given me life, and living; For here I read for certain, that my ships Are safely come to road.
How now, Lorenzo?
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starved people.
It is almost morning, And yet, I am sure, you are not satisfied Of these events at full.
Let us go in; And charge us there upon inter'gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.
Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa's ring. 
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes!
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals; The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love doing thee injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided in that case.
What say you, Hermia?
Be advis'd, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god; One that composed your beauties; yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax, By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
So is Lysander.
In himself he is; But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier.
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
Either to die the death, or to abjure For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon— The sealing-day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship,— Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life.
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield Thy crazed title to my certain right.
Scornful Lysander!
True, he hath my love; And what is mine my love shall render him; And she is mine; and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.
I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possess'd; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd, If not with vantage, as Demetrius'; And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along; I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial, and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
With duty and desire we follow you.
How now, my love!
Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
Ay me!
too high to be enthrall'd to low.
Or else misgraffed in respect of years— O spite!
too old to be engag'd to young.
to choose love by another's eyes.
A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee; And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us.
If thou lovest me then, Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night; And in the wood, a league without the town, Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May, There will I stay for thee.
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow, By his best arrow, with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen, When the false Trojan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke, In number more than ever women spoke, In that same place thou hast appointed me, Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
Keep promise, love.
Look, here comes Helena.
God speed fair Helena!
Whither away?
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
O that my prayers could such affection move!
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me.
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
I will, my Hermia.
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that?
Demetrius thinks not so; He will not know what all but he do know.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured everywhere; For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight; Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her; and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again. 
Is all our company here?
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night.
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
Marry, our play is, The Most Lamentable Comedy and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe.
Masters, spread yourselves.
Ready.
Name what part I am for, and proceed.
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
What is Pyramus?
A lover, or a tyrant?
A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I will condole in some measure.
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
Here, Peter Quince.
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
What is Thisbe?
A wandering knight?
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
Well, proceed.
Robin Starveling, the tailor.
Here, Peter Quince.
Here, Peter Quince.
Have you the lion's part written?
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
Let me play the lion too.
I will roar that I will do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar, that I will make the duke say ‘Let him roar again, let him roar again.’ An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.
That would hang us, every mother's son.
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
Well, I will undertake it.
What beard were I best to play it in?
Why, what you will.
I will discharge it in either your straw color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown color beard, your perfect yellow.
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play barefaced.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants.
I pray you, fail me not.
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
Take pains; be perfect; adieu.
At the duke's oak we meet.
Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings. 
How now, spirit!
whither wander you?
Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander every where, Swifter than the moon's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.
Our queen and all her elves come here anon.
The king doth keep his revels here tonight; Take heed the queen come not within his sight; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
And now they never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, But they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery, Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern, And bootless make the breathless housewife churn, And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
Thou speakest aright: I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile, When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal; And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab, And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob, And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
What, jealous Oberon!
Fairies, skip hence; I have forsworn his bed and company.
Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
Then I must be thy lady; but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love To amorous Phillida.
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair Aegle break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land, Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents.
The human mortals want their winter here; No night is now with hymn or carol blest; Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound.
And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose; And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set.
The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which.
Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; And for her sake do I rear up her boy; And for her sake I will not part with him.
How long within this wood intend you stay?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round, And see our moonlight revels, go with us; If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
Not for thy fairy kingdom.
Fairies, away.
We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
My gentle Puck, come hither.
Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew civil at her song, And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid's music.
I remember.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes.
And ere I take this charm from off her sight, As I can take it with another herb, I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here?
I am invisible; And I will overhear their conference.
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood, And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,— And yet a place of high respect with me,— Than to be used as you use your dog?
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; For I am sick when I do look on thee.
And I am sick when I look not on you.
You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not; To trust the opportunity of night, And the ill counsel of a desert place, With the rich worth of your virginity.
Your virtue is my privilege.
For that It is not night when I do see your face, Therefore I think I am not in the night; Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you, in my respect, are all the world.
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me?
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
Run when you will; the story shall be changed: Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed, When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do me mischief.
Fie, Demetrius!
I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well.
Welcome, wanderer.
Ay, there it is.
I pray thee give it me.
Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love.
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so. 
Come now, a roundel and a fairy song; Then, for the third part of a minute, hence: Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds; Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, To make my small elves coats; and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits.
Sing me now asleep; Then to your offices, and let me rest.
song] You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen; Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong, Come not near our fairy Queen.
Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby.
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
Philomel with melody, &amp;c. Hence away; now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood; And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way; We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good, And tarry for the comfort of the day.
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head.
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both; One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny, For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
Lysander riddles very prettily.
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I; And then end life when I end loyalty!
Through the forest have I gone, But Athenian found I none, On whose eyes I might approve This flower's force in stirring love.
Pretty soul!
she durst not lie Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
So awake when I am gone; For I must now to Oberon.
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
O, wilt thou darkling leave me?
Do not so.
Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here?
on the ground!
I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
Waking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena!
Nature shows art, That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius?
O, how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so.
What though he love your Hermia?
Lord, what though?
Content with Hermia!
The will of man is by his reason sway'd, And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season; So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason; And touching now the point of human skill, Reason becomes the marshal to my will, And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook Love's stories, written in Love's richest book.
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo.
O, that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
What, removed?
Lysander!
lord!
What, out of hearing?
gone?
No sound, no word?
Alack, where are you?
Speak, an if you hear; Speak, of all loves!
I swoon almost with fear.
Then I well perceive you are not nigh.
Either death or you I'll find immediately. 
Are we all met?
Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.
Peter Quince,— What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide.
How answer you that?
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
This will put them out of fear.
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
I fear it, I promise you.
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: —‘Ladies,’ —or ‘Fair ladies,—I would wish you’—or ‘I would request you’ —or ‘I would entreat you,—not to fear, not to tremble.
My life for yours!
If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life.
Well, it shall be so.
But there is two hard things; that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
A calendar, a calendar!
Yes, it doth shine that night.
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of moonshine.
Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
If that may be, then all is well.
Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
What hempen home-spuns have we swagg'ring here, So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward!
I'll be an auditor; An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
Must I speak now?
Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.
O strange!
We are haunted.
fly, masters!
Help!
I'll follow you; I'll lead you about a round, Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier; Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire; And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
Why do they run away?
This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
What do I see on thee?
What do you see?
You see an ass-head of your own, do you?
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could.
The ousel cock, so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill.
Awakening] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
Mine ear is much enamored of thy note; So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape; And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me, On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends.
Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
I am a spirit of no common rate; The summer still doth tend upon my state; And I do love thee; therefore, go with me.
Moth!
and Mustardseed!
Ready.
And I.
And I.
And I.
Where shall we go?
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes; Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries; The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, To have my love to bed and to arise; And pluck the wings from painted butterflies, To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
Hail, mortal!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
I cry your worships mercy, heartily; I beseech your worship's name.
Cobweb.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb.
Peaseblossom.
Mustardseed.
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well.
That same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house.
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.
I desire your more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye; And when she weeps, weeps every little flower; Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently. 
I wonder if Titania be awaked; Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity.
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play, Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented, in their sport Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake; When I did him at this advantage take, An ass's nole I fixed on his head.
Anon his Thisbe must be answered, And forth my mimic comes.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong, For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch; Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
I took him sleeping,—that is finish'd too,— And the Athenian woman by his side; That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
This is the woman, but not this the man.
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me.
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?
I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bored, and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him; So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
What's this to my Lysander?
Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
Out, dog!
out, cur!
Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden's patience.
Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake, And hast thou kill'd him sleeping?
O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
You spend your passion on a misprised mood: I am not guilty of Lysander's blood; Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
And from thy hated presence part I so; See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe; Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay.
What hast thou done?
Thou hast mistaken quite, And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
I go, I go; look how I go, Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery, Sink in apple of his eye.
Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand, And the youth, mistook by me Pleading for a lover's fee; Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!
Stand aside.
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears.
Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born, In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you, Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's.
Will you give her o'er?
I had no judgment when to her I swore.
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy.
O, how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow, Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand.
O, let me kiss This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
O spite!
O hell!
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment.
If you were civil and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do, But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show, You would not use a gentle lady so: To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia; And now both rivals, to mock Helena.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes With your derision!
None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin, and extort A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so; For you love Hermia.
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise so journ'd, And now to Helen is it home return'd, There to remain.
Helen, it is not so.
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
What love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me?
Could not this make thee know, The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia!
most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived, To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us,—O, is all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key; As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder, To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius, Who even but now did spurn me with his foot, To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent?
What though I be not so in grace as you, So hung upon with love, so fortunate, But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.
I understand not what you mean by this.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument.
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse; My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
O excellent!
Sweet, do not scorn her so.
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat; Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen, I love thee, by my life, I do; I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not.
I say I love thee more than he can do.
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
Away, you Ethiope!
You are a tame man; go!
Why are you grown so rude?
What change is this, Sweet love?
Thy love!
Out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine!
O hated potion, hence!
Do you not jest?
Yes, sooth; and so do you.
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
I would I had your bond; for I perceive A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
What!
Can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me!
wherefore?
O me!
what news, my love?
Am not I Hermia?
Are not you Lysander?
Why then, you left me,—O, the gods forbid!— In earnest, shall I say?
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena.
O me!
you juggler!
you cankerb lossom!
You thief of love!
What!
Have you come by night, And stolen my love's heart from him?
Fine, i' faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness?
What!
Will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie!
you counterfeit, you puppet you!
Ay, that way goes the game.
How low am I, thou painted maypole?
I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me.
I was never curst; I have no gift at all in shrewishness; I am a right maid for my cowardice; Let her not strike me.
You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her.
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia, Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you; Save that, in love unto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
Let me go.
You see how simple and how fond I am.
Why, get you gone!
Who is't that hinders you?
A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
What!
with Lysander?
With Demetrius.
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
Little’ again!
Let me come to her.
Get you gone, you dwarf; You minimus, of hind'ring knot-grass made; You bead, you acorn.
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services.
Follow!
Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you.
Nay, go not back.
I will not trust you, I; Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray; My legs are longer though, to run away.
I am amazed, and know not what to say.
This is thy negligence.
Still thou mistakest, Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes; And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong; And sometime rail thou like Demetrius; And from each other look thou lead them thus, Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye; Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision; And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ, I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy; And then I will her charmed eye release From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast; And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger, At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there, Troop home to churchyards.
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
I am fear'd in field and town.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
Speak thou now.
Here, villain, drawn and ready.
Where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me, then, To plainer ground.
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak!
In some bush?
Where dost thou hide thy head?
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, And wilt not come?
Come, recreant, come, thou child; I'll whip thee with a rod.
He is defiled That draws a sword on thee.
Yea, art thou there?
Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
He goes before me, and still dares me on; When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
Come, thou gentle day.
For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.
Ho, ho, ho!
Coward, why com'st thou not?
Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot Thou runnest before me, shifting every place, And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?
Come hither; I am here.
Nay, then, thou mock'st me.
O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours!
Yet but three?
Come one more; Two of both kinds makes up four.
Never so weary, never so in woe, Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers, I can no further crawl, no further go; My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed, While I thy amiable cheeks do coy, And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head, And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
Where's Peaseblossom?
Ready.
Ready.
Monsieur Cobweb; good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag.
Ready.
Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.
Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.
What's your will?
Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch.
I must to the barber's, monsieur; for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
I have a reasonable good ear in music.
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry oats.
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist; the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O, how I love thee!
how I dote on thee!
Welcome, good Robin.
See'st thou this sweet sight?
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell, like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes, Like tears, that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her, And she in mild terms begg'd my patience, I then did ask of her her changeling child; Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair, And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
Be as thou wast wont to be; See as thou was wont to see.
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
My Oberon!
What visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
There lies your love.
How came these things to pass?
Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
Now when thou wakest with thine own fool's eyes peep.
Sound, music.
Come, my Queen, take hands with me, And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity, And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, And bless it to all fair prosperity.
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
Fairy king, attend and mark; I do hear the morning lark.
Then, my Queen, in silence sad, Trip we after night's shade.
We the globe can compass soon, Swifter than the wandering moon.
Come, my lord; and in our flight, Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry.
I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew; Crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls; Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells, Each under each.
A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep, And this Lysander, this Demetrius is, This Helena, old Nedar's Helena.
I wonder of their being here together.
It is, my lord.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
Good-morrow, friends.
Saint Valentine is past; Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
Pardon, my lord.
I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies; How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
Our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, Without the peril of the Athenian law.
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood; And I in fury hither followed them, Fair Helena in fancy following me.
To her, my lord, Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia.
But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food; But, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it.
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met; Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will; For in the temple, by and by, with us These couples shall eternally be knit.
These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When every thing seems double.
Yea, and my father.
And Hippolyta.
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
Wakes) When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
My next is ‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho!
Peter Quince!
Flute, the bellows-mender!
Snout, the tinker!
Starveling!
God's my life, stolen hence, and left me asleep!
I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was.
Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this Methought I was—there is no man can tell what dream.
Methought I was, and methought I had, but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had.
The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.
It shall be call'd ‘Bottom's Dream,’ because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. 
Have you sent to Bottom's house?
Is he come home yet?
He cannot be heard of.
Out of doubt he is transported.
If he come not, then the play is marred; it goes not forward, doth it?
It is not possible.
You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.
You must say ‘paragon.’ A paramour is—God bless us!—A thing of naught.
Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.
If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.
O sweet bully Bottom!
He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.
Where are these lads?
Where are these hearts?
O most courageous day!
O most happy hour!
I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
Not a word of me.
All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath dined.
Get your apparel together; good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred.
In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws.
And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy.
No more words.
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
More strange than true.
I never may believe These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, Are of imagination all compact.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold; That is the madman.
The lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination That, if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy; Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear?
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy's images, And grows to something of great constancy, But howsoever strange and admirable.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts!
More than to us Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have, To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand?
Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.
Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
What masque?
what music?
How shall we beguile The lazy time, if not with some delight?
There is a brief how many sports are ripe; Make choice of which your Highness will see first.
tedious and brief!
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play; But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious; for in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
What are they that do play it?
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, Which never labour'd in their minds till now; And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial.
And we will hear it.
No, my noble lord, It is not for you.
I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world; Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain, To do you service.
I will hear that play; For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it.
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged, And duty in his service perishing.
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake; And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes; Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practised accent in their fears, And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome.
Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome; And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity.
So please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
Let him approach.
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend, But with good will.
To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then, we come but in despite.
We do not come, as minding to content you, Our true intent is.
All for your delight We are not here.
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop.
Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder,—a sound, but not in government.
His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all disordered.
Who is next?
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know; This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know, By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night, Did scare away, or rather did affright; And as she fled, her mantle she did fall; Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain, At large discourse while here they do remain.
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
O grim-look'd night!
O night with hue so black!
O night, which ever art when day is not!
Thanks, courteous wall.
Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I?
No Thisbe do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss, Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me!
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
No, in truth, sir, he should not.
Deceiving me is Thisbe's cue.
She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.
You shall see it will fall pat as I told you; yonder she comes.
O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
I see a voice; now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face.
Thisbe!
My love!
thou art my love, I think.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace; And like Limander am I trusty still.
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
Thus have I, wall, my part discharged so; And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
Now is the mural down between the two neighbors.
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men.
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
This lion is a very fox for his valour.
True; and a goose for his discretion.
Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose carries not the fox.
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present; Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
How is it else the man i' the moon?
He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.
I am aweary of this moon.
Would he would change!
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.
Proceed, Moon.
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man i' the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these are in the moon.
But silence; here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny's tomb.
Where is my love?
Well run, Thisbe.
Well moused, Lion.
And then came Pyramus.
And so the lion vanished.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it he?
O dainty duck!
O dear!
Thy mantle good, What!
stain'd with blood?
Approach, ye Furies fell.
O Fates!
come, come; Cut thread and thrum; Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear; Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer.
Come, tears, confound; Out, sword, and wound The pap of Pyramus; Ay, that left pap, Where heart doth hop.
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead, Now am I fled; My soul is in the sky.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass.
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better,—he for a man, God warrant us: She for a woman, God bless us!
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
And thus she moans, videlicet:— Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise, Speak, speak.
Quite dumb?
Dead, dead?
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.
O Sisters Three, Come, come to me, With hands as pale as milk; Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
Dies] [Dies] Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Ay, and Wall too.
No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers.
Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?
No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse.
Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed.
Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.
And so it is, truly; and very notably discharged.
But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn, As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire; Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier; And this ditty, after me, Sing and dance it trippingly.
Now, until the break of day, Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we, Which by us shall blessed be; And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate.
Trip away; make no stay; Meet me all by break of day.
If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended, That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, Gentles, do not reprehend.
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. 
Tush, never tell me!
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
Sblood, but you will not hear me.
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
Despise me, if I do not.
Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, Where in the toga'd consuls can propose As masterly as he; mere prattle without practice, Is all his soldiership.
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
Why, there's no remedy.
Tis the curse of service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first.
Now, sir, be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor.
I would not follow him then.
You shall mark Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave, That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, For naught but provender; and, when he's old, cashier'd.
Whip me such honest knaves.
Others there are, Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage.
These fellows have some soul, And such a one do I profess myself.
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe, If he can carry't thus!
Though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on't As it may lose some color.
Do; with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.
What, ho, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!
Awake!
What, ho, Brabantio!
thieves!
thieves!
thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Thieves!
thieves!
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?
Signior, is all your family within?
Are your doors lock'd?
Arise, I say!
What, have you lost your wits?
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
What are you?
My name is Roderigo.
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors: In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,— Being full of supper and distempering draughts,— Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come To start my quiet.
Sir, sir, sir— But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee.
Patience, good sir.
What tell'st thou me of robbing?
This is Venice; My house is not a grange.
Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you.
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.
What profane wretch art thou?
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
Thou art a villain.
You are—a senator.
Sir, I will answer any thing.
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!
Farewell, for I must leave you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, To be produced—as, if I stay, I shall— Against the Moor.
For I do know, the state, However this may gall him with some check, Cannot with safety cast him; for he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus' wars, Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls, Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business; in which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains, Yet for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, Which is indeed but sign.
That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raised search, And there will I be with him.
So farewell.
How didst thou know 'twas she?
Raise all my kindred.
Are they married, think you?
Truly, I think they are.
O heaven!—How got she out?
O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act.
Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Call up my brother.
Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard, and go along with me.
Pray you, lead on.
Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience To do no contrived murder.
I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service.
Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
Tis better as it is.
Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him.
But I pray you, sir, Are you fast married?
Be assured of this, That the magnifico is much beloved, And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke's.
He will divorce you, Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law, with all his might to enforce it on, Will give him cable.
Let him do his spite.
My services, which I have done the signiory, Shall out-tongue his complaints.
But, look!
What lights come yond?
Those are the raised father and his friends.
You were best go in.
Is it they?
By Janus, I think no.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?
The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant.
What is the matter, think you?
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels; And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the Duke's already.
You have been hotly call'd for; When, being not at your lodging to be found, The Senate hath sent about three quests To search you out.
Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.
Ancient, what makes he here?
I do not understand.
He's married.
To who?
Marry, to—Come, captain, will you go?
Have with you.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
It is Brabantio.—General, be advised; He comes to bad intent.
Holla!
Stand there!
Signior, it is the Moor.
You, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I am for you.
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her, For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.— Lay hold upon him.
If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril.
To prison; till fit time Of law and course of direct session, Call thee to answer.
What if I do obey?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side, Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him?
Tis true, most worthy signior; The Duke's in council, and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
How?
The Duke in council?
The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. 
There is no composition in these news That gives them credit.
Indeed they are disproportion'd; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
And mine, a hundred and forty.
And mine, two hundred.
What, ho!
What, ho!
What, ho!
A messenger from the galleys.
Now, what's the business?
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo.
How say you by this change?
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
Here is more news.
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
Ay, so I thought.
How many, as you guess?
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.
Tis certain then for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
He's now in Florence.
Write from us to him, postposthaste dispatch.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman.
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
So did I yours.
Why, what's the matter?
My daughter!
O, my daughter!
Dead?
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense.
Humbly I thank your Grace.
Here is the man, this Moor; whom now, it seems, Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought.
We are very sorry for't.
What in your own part can you say to this?
Nothing, but this is so.
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approved good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most true; true, I have married her; The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more.
Rude am I in my speech, And little blest with the soft phrase of peace; For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broil and battle; And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms, What conjuration, and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter.
A maiden never bold; Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush'd at herself; and she—in spite of nature, Of years, of country, credit, everything— To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect, That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature, I therefore vouch again, That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, Or with some dram conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.
To vouch this, is no proof, Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
But, Othello, speak.
Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request, and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?
Fetch Desdemona hither.
Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood, So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mine.
Say it, Othello.
Her father loved me, oft invited me, Still question'd me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have pass'd.
This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline; But still the house affairs would draw her thence, Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse; which I observing, Took once a pliant hour, and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not intentively.
I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty.
To you I am bound for life and education; My life and education both do learn me How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, I am hitherto your daughter.
But here's my husband, And so much duty as my mother show'd To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor, my lord.
God be with you!
I have done.
For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child; For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.
I have done, my lord.
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers Into your favor.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes, Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
These sentences, to sugar or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you.
You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down.
I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness; and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife, Due reference of place and exhibition, With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding.
Nor I.
Nor I. I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye.
Most gracious Duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear.
What would you, Desdemona?
That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, A moth of peace, and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence.
Let me go with him.
Let her have your voices.
No, when lightwing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instruments, That my disports corrupt and taint my business, Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation!
Tonight, my lord?
This night.
With all my heart.
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind, And he shall our commission bring to you; With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you.
Let it be so.
Good night to everyone.
And, noble signior, If virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
My life upon her faith!
Iago!
What say'st thou, noble heart?
What will I do, thinkest thou?
Why, go to bed and sleep.
I will incontinently drown myself.
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
Why, thou silly gentleman!
It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
O villainous!
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself.
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
Virtue?
a fig!
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.
It cannot be.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will.
Come, be a man!
Drown thyself?
Drown cats and blind puppies!
Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard.
It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answer- able sequestration; put but money in thy purse.
These Moors are changeable in their wills:—fill thy purse with money.
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida.
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.
A pox of drowning thyself!
It is clean out of the way.
Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason.
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.
If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport.
There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Traverse, go, provide thy money.
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
At my lodging.
I'll be with thee betimes.
Go to, farewell.
Do you hear, Roderigo?
What say you?
No more of drowning, do you hear?
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse; For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit.
I hate the Moor; And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office.
I know not if't be true; But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety.
He holds me well; The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man.
Let me see now: To get his place, and to plume up my will In double knavery—How, how?
He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected; framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature, That thinks men honest that but seem to be so; And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are.
I have't.
It is engender'd.
Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. 
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
Nothing at all.
It is a highwrought flood; I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, Descry a sail.
What shall we hear of this?
If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd; It is impossible to bear it out.
News, lads!
Our wars are done.
How?
Is this true?
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted With foul and violent tempest.
Pray heavens he be; For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier.
Come, let's do so; For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle, That so approve the Moor!
O, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
Is he well shipp'd?
His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance; Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure.
A sail, a sail, a sail!
What noise?
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea Stand ranks of people, and they cry, “A sail!” My hopes do shape him for the governor.
I pray you, sir, go forth, And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
I shall.
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
How now!
who has put in?
Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
What is she?
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, Left in the conduct of the bold Iago; Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight's speed.
Great Jove, Othello guard, And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits, And bring all Cyprus comfort.
O, behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hail to thee, lady!
And the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round!
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
He is not yet arrived; nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here.
O, but I fear—How lost you company?
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship—But, hark!
a sail.
See for the news.
Good ancient, you are welcome.
Welcome, mistress.
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You'ld have enough.
Alas, she has no speech.
In faith, too much; I find it still when I have list to sleep: Marry, before your ladyship, I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.
You have little cause to say so.
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
You shall not write my praise.
No, let me not.
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?
O gentle lady, do not put me to't; For I am nothing if not critical.
Ay, madam.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
I am about it; but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze; It plucks out brains and all.
But my Muse labors, And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, The one's for use, the other useth it.
Well praised!
How if she be black and witty?
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
Worse and worse.
How if fair and foolish?
She never yet was foolish that was fair; For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse.
What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish?
Thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
O most lame and impotent conclusion!
Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.
How say you, Cassio?
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?
He speaks home, madam.
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio.
Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
You say true; 'tis so, indeed.
If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in.
an excellent courtesy!
tis so, indeed.
Yet again your fingers to your lips?
Would they were clysterpipes for your sake!
The Moor!
I know his trumpet.
Tis truly so.
Let's meet him and receive him.
Lo, where he comes!
O my fair warrior!
My dear Othello!
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me.
O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high, and duck again as low As hell's from heaven!
If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow!
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content; It stops me here; it is too much of joy: And this, and this, the greatest discords be They kiss.
O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am.
Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus; I have found great love amongst them.
O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote In mine own comforts.
Come, Desdemona, Once more well met at Cyprus.
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.
Come hither.
If thou be'st valiant—as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list me.
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.
First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
With him?
Why, 'tis not possible.
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for prating?
Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil?
When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defec- tive in.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?
A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better com- passing of his salt and most hidden loose affection?
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest condition.
Blest fig'send!
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.
If she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor.
Blest pudding!
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?
Didst not mark that?
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!
When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion.
Pish!
But, sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.
Cassio knows you not.
I'll not be far from you.
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qual- ification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, with- out the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
I warrant thee.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
Farewell.
Adieu.
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial.
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed.
All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven.
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! 
Iago hath direction what to do; But notwithstanding, with my personal eye Will I look to't.
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night.
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.
Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock.
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame.
He hath not yet made wan- ton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.
She's a most exquisite lady.
And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
What an eye she has!
Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
She is indeed perfection.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
O, they are our friends!
But one cup; I'll drink for you.
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.
I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.
What, man!
Where are they?
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.
Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.
Some wine, ho!
And let me the canakin clink, clink; [Sings.
Fore God, an excellent song.
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
To the health of our general!
King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown; He held them sixpence all too dear, With that he call'd the tailor lown.
Will you hear't again?
It's true, good lieutenant.
For mine own part—no offense to the general, nor any man of quality—I hope to be saved.
And so do I too, lieutenant.
Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs.
God forgive us our sins!
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
Excellent well.
And do but see his vice; 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, The one as long as the other.
Tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island.
But is he often thus?
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep; He'll watch the horologe a double set, If drink rock not his cradle.
It were well The general were put in mind of it.
How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
What noise?
You rogue!
You rascal!
What's the matter, lieutenant?
A knave teach me my duty!
But I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
Beat me!
Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
Come, come, you're drunk.
Drunk!
What is the matter here?
Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
Hold, for your lives!
Hold, ho!—Lieutenant—sir—Montano—gentlemen— Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold!
Why, how now, ho!
from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving, Speak, who began this?
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted, and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure.
What's the matter, That you unlace your reputation thus, And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler?
Give me answer to it.
Nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night; Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.
Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgement collied, Assays to lead the way.
If I once stir, Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke.
Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on, And he that is approved in this offense, Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, Shall lose me.
What!
in a town of war, Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel, In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
Tis monstrous.
Iago, who began't?
If partially affined, or leagued in office, Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, Thou art no soldier.
Touch me not so near: I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio; Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.
Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help, And Cassio following him with determined sword, To execute upon him.
He, swift of foot, Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords, And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight I ne'er might say before.
When I came back— For this was brief —I found them close together, At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
But men are men; the best sometimes forget: Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received From him that fled some strange indignity, Which patience could not pass.
I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio.
Cassio, I love thee; But never more be officer of mine.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.
What's the matter?
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.
Lead him off.
Iago, look with care about the town, And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Ay, past all surgery.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
O, I have lost my reputation!
I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial.
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputa- tion.
Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and lost without deserving.
You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser.
What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again.
You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion.
Sue to him again, and he's yours.
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.
Drunk?
and speak parrot?
and squabble?
swagger?
swear?
and discourse fustian with one's own shadow?
O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?
I know not.
Is't possible?
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore.
O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!
that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
Why, but you are now well enough.
How came you thus recovered?
Come, you are too severe a moraler.
As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast!
O strange!
Every inordinate cup is unblest, and the ingredient is a devil.
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.
Exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
I have well approved it, sir.
I drunk!
You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man.
I'll tell you what you shall do.
Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again.
She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
You advise me well.
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
You are in the right.
Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.
Good night, honest Iago.
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking, and indeed the course To win the Moor again?
For 'tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit.
She's framed as fruitful As the free elements.
And then for her To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function.
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good?
Divinity of hell!
So will I turn her virtue into pitch, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.
How now, Roderigo!
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well?
By the mass, 'tis morning; Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted: Away, I say.
Thou shalt know more hereafter: Nay, get thee gone.
Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something that's brief; and bid “Good morrow, general.” Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus?
How, sir, how?
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
Marry, sir.
Well, sir, we will not.
We have none such, sir.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
There's a poor piece of gold for thee.
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech.
Wilt thou do this?
Do, good my friend.
In happy time, Iago.
You have not been abed, then?
Why, no; the day had broke Before we parted.
I have made bold, Iago, To send in to your wife.
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.
I'll send her to you presently; And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way, that your converse and business May be more free.
I humbly thank you for't.
I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest.
The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly.
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you, And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again.
Yet, I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone.
Pray you, come in.
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.
I am much bound to you. 
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
We'll wait upon your lordship. 
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.
O, that's an honest fellow.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He's never anything but your true servant.
Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.
My lord shall never rest; I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; I'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio's suit.
Therefore be merry, Cassio, For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away.
Madam, here comes my lord.
Madam, I'll take my leave.
Nay, stay and hear me speak.
Madam, not now.
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.
Well, do your discretion.
Ha!
I like not that.
What dost thou say?
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
Cassio, my lord!
No, sure, I cannot think it, That he would steal away so guiltylike, Seeing you coming.
I do believe 'twas he.
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.
Who is't you mean?
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.
Went he hence now?
Ay, sooth; so humbled, That he hath left part of his grief with me, To suffer with him.
Good love, call him back.
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
But shall't be shortly?
The sooner, sweet, for you.
Shall't be tonight at supper?
No, not tonight.
Tomorrow dinner then?
I shall not dine at home; I meet the captains at the citadel.
In faith, he's penitent; And yet his trespass, in our common reason— Save that, they say, the wars must make examples Out of their best—is not almost a fault To incur a private check.
When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello.
I wonder in my soul, What you would ask me, that I should deny, Or stand so mammering on.
What?
Nay, when I have a suit— Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, It shall be full of poise and difficult weight, And fearful to be granted.
Shall I deny you?
No.
Farewell, my lord.
Emilia, come.
Be as your fancies teach you; Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Excellent wretch!
Perdition catch my soul, But I do love thee!
and when I love thee not, Chaos is come again.
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, Know of your love?
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?
But for a satisfaction of my thought; No further harm.
Why of thy thought, Iago?
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
O, yes, and went between us very oft.
Indeed!
Indeed?
ay, indeed.
Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
Honest, my lord?
Honest?
Ay, honest.
My lord, for aught I know.
What dost thou think?
Think, my lord?
Think, my lord?
By heaven, he echoes me, As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown.
What didst not like?
If thou dost love me, Show me thy thought.
My lord, you know I love you.
I think thou dost; And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just They're close dilations, working from the heart, That passion cannot rule.
For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
I think so too.
Men should be what they seem; Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
Certain, men should be what they seem.
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
Utter my thoughts?
Why, say they are vile and false; As where's that palace where in to foul things Sometimes intrude not?
Who has a breast so pure, But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays, and in session sit With meditations lawful?
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.
I do beseech you— Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, As, I confess, it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet, From one that so imperfectly conceits, Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good, Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, To let you know my thoughts.
What dost thou mean?
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
Ha!
That cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
O misery!
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions?
Exchange me for a goat, When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, Matching thy inference.
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well; Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; For she had eyes and chose me.
No, Iago, I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this, Away at once with love or jealousy!
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit.
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.
I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.
I know our country disposition well; In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
Dost thou say so?
She did deceive her father, marrying you; And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most.
And so she did.
I am bound to thee forever.
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
Not a jot, not a jot.
I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love.
But I do see you're moved; I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues, nor to larger reach Than to suspicion.
I will not.
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aim not at.
No, not much moved.
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
Long live she so!
and long live you to think so!
But pardon me.
I do not in position Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear, Her will, recoiling to her better judgement, May fall to match you with her country forms, And happily repent.
Leave me, Iago.
My lord, I take my leave.
Why did I marry?
This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears— As worthy cause I have to fear I am— And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
Fear not my government.
I once more take my leave.
This fellow's of exceeding honesty, And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, Of human dealings.
If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune.
O curse of marriage, That we can call these delicate creatures ours, And not their appetites!
I had rather be a toad, And live upon the vapor of a dungeon, Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses.
Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; Prerogatived are they less than the base; 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken.
I'll not believe't.
How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence.
I am to blame.
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?
I have a pain upon my forehead here.
Come, I'll go in with you.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
I'll have the work ta'en out, And give't Iago.
What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I; I nothing but to please his fantasy.
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
A thing for me?
It is a common thing— Ha!
To have a foolish wife.
O, is that all?
What will you give me now For that same handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona; That which so often you did bid me steal.
Hast stol'n it from her?
Look, here it is.
A good wench; give it me.
What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it?
Why, what is that to you?
If't be not for some purpose of import, Give't me again.
Poor lady, she'll run mad When she shall lack it.
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin, And let him find it.
Not poppy, nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday.
Why, how now, general!
No more of that.
Avaunt!
be gone!
How now, my lord?
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I am sorry to hear this.
I had been happy if the general camp, Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.
O, now forever Farewell the tranquil mind!
Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue!
O, farewell, Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spiritstirring drum, the earpiercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit, Farewell!
Othello's occupation's gone!
Is't possible, my lord?
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore; Be sure of it.
Give me the ocular proof; Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath!
Is't come to this?
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it, That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
O grace!
O heaven defend me!
Are you a man?
have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office.
O wretched fool, That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world!
Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit, and from hence I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.
I should be wise; for honesty's a fool, And loses that it works for.
By the world, I think my wife be honest, and think she is not; I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof.
Her name, that was as fresh As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face.
If there be cords or knives, Poison or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it.
Would I were satisfied!
You would be satisfied?
Would?
Nay, I will.
And may.
But, how?
how satisfied, my lord?
Death and damnation!
O!
It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect.
Damn them then, If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own!
What then?
how then?
What shall I say?
Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.
But yet, I say, If imputation and strong circumstances, Which lead directly to the door of truth, Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
I do not like the office; But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love, I will go on.
I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.
Nay, this was but his dream.
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
Tell me but this; Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
Now do I see 'tis true.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate!
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
Yet be content.
O, blood, blood, blood!
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.
Damn her, lewd minx!
O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.
Now art thou my lieutenant.
I am your own forever. 
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
Why, man?
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is stab- bing.
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
Can anything be made of this?
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make ques- tions and by them answer.
Seek him, bid him come hither.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
I know not, madam.
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.
Is he not jealous?
Who, he?
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.
Look, where he comes.
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to him.
How is't with you, my lord?
Well, my good lady.
O, hardness to dissemble!
How do you, Desdemona?
Well, my good lord.
Give me your hand.
This hand is moist, my lady.
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, Much castigation, exercise devout, For here's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels.
Tis a good hand, A frank one.
You may, indeed, say so; For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of old gave hands; But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
I cannot speak of this.
Come now, your promise.
What promise, chuck?
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; Lend me thy handkerchief.
Here, my lord.
That which I gave you.
I have it not about me.
Not?
No, faith, my lord.
That's a fault.
That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give; She was a charmer, and could almost read The thoughts of people.
She told her, while she kept it, 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made a gift of it, my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies.
She dying gave it me, And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, To give it her.
Is't possible?
Indeed!
is't true?
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
Ha!
wherefore?
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
Is't lost?
is't gone?
speak, is it out o' the way?
Heaven bless us!
Say you?
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
How?
I say, it is not lost.
Fetch't, let me see it.
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
Come, come; You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
The handkerchief!
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, Shared dangers with you— The handkerchief!
In sooth, you are to blame.
Away!
Is not this man jealous?
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief; I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
Go and importune her.
How now, good Cassio!
What's the news with you?
I would not be delay'd.
Alas, thrice gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune; My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified, As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech!
You must awhile be patient.
What I can do I will; and more I will Than for myself I dare.
Let that suffice you.
Is my lord angry?
He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness.
Can he be angry?
Something of moment then.
I prithee, do so.
Something sure of state, Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object.
Tis even so; For let our finger ache, and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain.
Nay, we must think men are not gods, I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, Arraigning his unkindness with my soul; But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, And he's indicted falsely.
Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think, And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you.
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so; They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they are jealous.
Tis a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
Lady, amen.
I will go seek him.
Cassio, walk hereabout.
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit, And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Save you, friend Cassio!
What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours?
and lovers' absent hours, More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend.
Well, well.
Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, From whence you have them.
You are jealous now That this is from some mistress, some remembrance: No, by my faith, Bianca.
Why, whose is it?
I know not, sweet.
I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well.
Leave you!
wherefore?
I do attend here on the general; And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me woman'd.
Why, I pray you?
Not that I love you not.
But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little; And say if I shall see you soon at night.
Tis very good; I must be circumstanced. 
Will you think so?
Think so, Iago?
What, To kiss in private?
An unauthorized kiss.
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers, She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
Ay, what of that?
That's not so good now.
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
He hath, my lord; but be you well assured, No more than he'll unswear.
What hath he said?
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
What?
what?
With her, on her, what you will.
Zounds, that's fulsome!
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction.
It is not words that shakes me thus.
Pish!
Noses, ears, and lips.
Is't possible?
Confess?—Handkerchief?—O devil!
Work on, My medicine, work!
Thus credulous fools are caught: And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach.
What, ho!
My lord!
My lord, I say!
Othello!
How now, Cassio!
What's the matter?
Rub him about the temples.
Look, he stirs: Do you withdraw yourself a little while, He will recover straight.
When he is gone, I would on great occasion speak with you.
How is it, general?
Have you not hurt your head?
Dost thou mock me?
I mock you?
No, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
There's many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster.
Did he confess it?
Good sir, be a man; Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you.
There's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar.
Your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's archmock, To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste!
No, let me know; And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
Stand you awhile apart; Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief— A passion most unsuiting such a man— Cassio came hither.
I shifted him away, And laid good ‘scuse upon your ecstasy; Bade him anon return and here speak with me; The which he promised.
Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, That dwell in every region of his face; For I will make him tell the tale anew, Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath and is again to cope your wife: I say, but mark his gesture.
Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.
Dost thou hear, Iago?
That's not amiss; But yet keep time in all.
Will you withdraw?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes.
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter.
Here he comes.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior, Quite in the wrong.
How do you now, lieutenant?
The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me.
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power, How quickly should you speed!
Alas, poor caitiff!
Look, how he laughs already!
I never knew a woman love man so.
Alas, poor rogue!
I think, i'faith, she loves me.
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
Do you hear, Cassio?
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.
Go to; well said, well said.
Ha, ha, ha!
Do you triumph, Roman?
Do you triumph?
I marry her!
What?
A customer!
I prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!
So, so, so, so.
They laugh that win.
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
Prithee, say true.
I am a very villain else.
Have you scored me?
Well.
This is the monkey's own giving out.
She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.
O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
Well, I must leave her company.
Before me!
look where she comes.
Tis such another fitchew!
marry, a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it.
I must take out the work?
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there!
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?
There, give it your hobby-horse.
Wheresoever you had it, I'll take out no work on't.
How now, my sweet Bianca!
how now!
how now!
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for.
After her, after her.
Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
Will you sup there?
Faith, I intend so.
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.
Prithee, come; will you?
Go to; say no more.
How shall I murder him, Iago?
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
O Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?
Was that mine?
Yours, by this hand.
And to see how he prizes the fool- ish woman your wife!
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
I would have him nine years akilling.
A fine woman!
a fair woman!
a sweet woman!
Nay, you must forget that.
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not live.
No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand.
O, the world hath not a sweeter creature.
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.
Nay, that's not your way.
Hang her!
I do but say what she is.
O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear.
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!
She's the worse for all this.
O, a thousand, a thousand times.
And then, of so gentle a condition!
Ay, too gentle.
Nay, that's certain.
But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
I will chop her into messes.
Cuckold me!
O, 'tis foul in her.
With mine officer!
That's fouler.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again.
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
You shall hear more by midnight.
Excellent good.
A trumpet without.
What trumpet is that same?
Something from Venice, sure.
Tis Lodovico Come from the Duke.
And, see your wife is with him.
God save the worthy general!
With all my heart, sir.
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
I am very glad to see you, signior; Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you.
How does Lieutenant Cassio?
Lives, sir.
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breech; but you shall make all well.
Are you sure of that?
My lord?
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one.
I would do much To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
Fire and brimstone!
My lord?
Are you wise?
What, is he angry?
May be the letter moved him; For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government.
By my troth, I am glad on't.
Indeed!
My lord?
I am glad to see you mad.
I have not deserved this.
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw't.
O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!
I will not stay to offend you.
Mistress!
My lord?
What would you with her, sir?
Who, I, my lord?
Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir—O well-painted passion!— I am commanded home.
Get you away; I'll send for you anon.
Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice.
Hence, avaunt!
Cassio shall have my place.
And, sir, tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
Goats and monkeys!
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient?
This the nature Whom passion could not shake?
whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce?
He is much changed.
Are his wits safe?
Is he not light of brain?
He's that he is.
What, strike his wife!
Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood, And new create this fault?
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.
I am sorry that I am deceived in him. 
You have seen nothing, then?
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.
What, did they never whisper?
Never, my lord.
Nor send you out o' the way?
Never.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
Never, my lord.
That's strange.
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake.
If any wretch have put this in your head, Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true, There's no man happy; the purest of their wives Is foul as slander.
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd That cannot say as much.
My lord, what is your will?
Pray, chuck, come hither.
What is your pleasure?
Let me see your eyes; Look in my face.
What horrible fancy's this?
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words, But not the words.
Why, what art thou?
Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
Come, swear it, damn thyself; Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee.
Therefore be doubledamn'd; Swear thou art honest.
Heaven doth truly know it.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
To whom, my lord?
with whom?
how am I false?
O Desdemona!
Away!
away!
away!
Alas the heavy day!
Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me.
If you have lost him: Why, I have lost him too.
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!
Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and roselipp'd cherubin, Ay, there, look grim as hell!
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing.
O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write “whore” upon?
What committed?
Committed!
O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks, That would to cinders burn up modesty, Did I but speak thy deeds.
What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks; The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, And will not hear it.
What committed.
Impudent strumpet!
By heaven, you do me wrong.
Are not you a strumpet?
No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
What, not a whore?
No, as I shall be saved.
Is't possible?
O, heaven forgive us!
You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, And keep the gate of hell!
You, you, ay, you!
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam?
How do you, my good lady?
Faith, half asleep.
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
With who?
Why, with my lord, madam.
Who is thy lord?
He that is yours, sweet lady.
I have none.
Do not talk to me, Emilia; I cannot weep, nor answer have I none But what should go by water.
Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.
Remember; And call thy husband hither.
Here's a change indeed!
Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is't with you?
I cannot tell.
What's the matter, lady?
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, As true hearts cannot bear.
Am I that name, Iago?
What name, fair lady?
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
Why did he so?
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
Do not weep, do not weep.
Alas the day!
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country and her friends, To be call'd whore?
Would it not make one weep?
It is my wretched fortune.
How comes this trick upon him?
Nay, heaven doth know.
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
A halter pardon him!
And hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore?
Who keeps her company?
What place?
What time?
What form?
What likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west!
Speak within door.
O, fie upon them!
Some such squire he was That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
You are a fool; go to.
O good Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him.
Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love.
If 'twere no other— 'Tis but so, I warrant.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
How now, Roderigo!
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
What in the contrary?
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conve- niency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope.
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and per- formances are no kin together.
You charge me most unjustly.
With nought but truth.
I have wasted myself out of my means.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist.
Well, go to, very well.
Very well!
go to!
I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well.
By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.
Very well.
I tell you 'tis not very well.
You have said now.
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before.
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy affair.
It hath not appeared.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and compass?
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
Is that true?
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
How do you mean, removing of him?
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains.
And that you would have me to do?
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune.
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.
It is now high sup- pertime, and the night grows to waste.
About it.
I will hear further reason for this.
And you shall be satisfied. 
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
O, pardon me; ‘twill do me good to walk.
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
Your honor is most welcome.
Will you walk, sir?
O—Desdemona— My lord?
I will, my lord.
How goes it now?
He looks gentler than he did.
Dismiss me?
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
We must not now displease him.
I would you had never seen him!
So would not I.
My love doth so approve him, That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns— Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor in them.
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
All's one.
Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me In one of those same sheets.
Come, come, you talk.
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara; She was in love, and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her.
She had a song of “willow”; An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, And she died singing it.
Prithee, dispatch.
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
A very handsome man.
He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, Sing all a green willow; Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow, willow.
It's the wind.
I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
Mine eyes do itch; Doth that bode weeping?
Tis neither here nor there.
I have heard it said so.
O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia— That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?
There be some such, no question.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Why, would not you?
No, by this heavenly light!
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well i' the dark.
Wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world?
The world's a huge thing; it is a great price For a final vice.
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a jointring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?
I should venture purgatory for't.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world.
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and hav- ing the world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
I do not think there is any such woman.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for.
What is it that they do When they change us for others?
Is it sport?
I think it doth.
Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.
And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Good night, good night.
Heaven me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! 
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, And fix most firm thy resolution.
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
Forth, my sword; he dies.
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, And he grows angry.
Now, whether he kill Cassio, Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, Every way makes my gain.
Live Roderigo, He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him, As gifts to Desdemona; It must not be.
If Cassio do remain, He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril: No, he must die.
I know his gait; 'tis he.
Villain, thou diest!
O, I am slain!
I am maim'd forever.
Help, ho!
Murder!
Murder!
O, villain that I am!
It is even so.
O, help, ho!
Light!
A surgeon!
Tis he.
O brave Iago, honest and just, That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Strumpet, I come!
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted; Thy bed, lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
What, ho!
No watch?
No passage?
Murder!
Murder!
Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
O, help!
Hark!
O wretched villain!
Nobody come?
Then shall I bleed to death.
Hark!
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
Who's there?
Did not you hear a cry?
Here, here!
for heaven's sake, help me!
What's the matter?
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
What are you here that cry so grievously?
Iago?
O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
O me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?
I think that one of them is hereabout, And cannot make away.
O treacherous villains!
What are you there?
Come in and give some help.
O, help me here!
That's one of them.
O murderous slave!
O villain!
O damn'd Iago!
O inhuman dog!
Kill men i' the dark!
Where be these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town!
Ho!
Murder!
Murder!
What may you be?
Are you of good or evil?
As you shall prove us, praise us.
Signior Lodovico?
He, sir.
I cry you mercy.
Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
Cassio?
How is't, brother?
My leg is cut in two.
Marry, heaven forbid!
What is the matter, ho?
Who is't that cried?
Who is't that cried!
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
O notable strumpet!
Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
No.
Lend me a garter.
So.
O, for a chair, To bear him easily hence!
Alas, he faints!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio.
Come, come; Lend me a light.
Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo?
No—yes, sure.
O heaven!
Roderigo.
What, of Venice?
Even he, sir.
Did you know him?
Know him!
ay.
Signior Gratiano?
I cry you gentle pardon; These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, That so neglected you.
O, a chair, a chair!
Roderigo!
He, he, ’tis he.
Some good man bear him carefully from hence; I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
For you, mistress, Save you your labor.
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
What, look you pale?
O, bear him out o' the air.
Stay you, good gentlemen.
Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
Do you see, gentlemen?
Nay, guiltiness will speak, Though tongues were out of use.
Las, what's the matter?
What's the matter, husband?
Alas, good gentleman!
alas, good Cassio!
This is the fruit of whoring.
Prithee, Emilia, Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.
What, do you shake at that?
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
O, did he so?
I charge you, go with me.
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
I am no strumpet, but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me.
As I!
foh!
fie upon thee!
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel, And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
Will you go on?
Aside.
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite. 
It is the cause.
Yet I'll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword!
One more, one more; Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And love thee after.
One more, and this the last: So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
She wakes.
Who's there?
Othello?
Ay, Desdemona.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
Ay, my lord.
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, Solicit for it straight.
Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
I would not kill thy soul.
Talk you of killing?
Ay, I do.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
Amen, with all my heart!
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
Hum!
And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so.
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
Think on thy sins.
They are loves I bear to you.
Ay, and for that thou diest.
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Peace, and be still!
I will so.
What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio.
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.
Sweet soul, take heed, Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.
Ay, but not yet to die.
Thou art to die.
Then Lord have mercy on me!
I say, amen.
And have you mercy too!
I never did Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love.
I never gave him token.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ‘s hand.
O perjured woman!
He found it then; I never gave it him.
He hath confess'd.
What, my lord?
That he hath used thee.
How?
unlawfully?
Ay.
He will not say so.
No, his mouth is stopp'd; Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O, my fear interprets!
What, is he dead?
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge Had stomach for them all.
Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!
Out, strumpet!
Weep'st thou for him to my face?
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
Down, strumpet!
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
Nay, if you strive— But half an hour!
Being done, there is no pause.
But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
My lord, my lord!
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
What noise is this?
Not dead?
not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful; I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
Who's there?
O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
By and by.
She's dead.
Ha!
no more moving?
Still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
were't good?
I think she stirs again.
No.
What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.
My wife!
My wife!
What wife?
I have no wife.
O, insupportable!
O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration.
I do beseech you That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
I had forgot thee.
O, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by.
Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
What's the matter with thee now?
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!
What, now?
But now, my lord.
It is the very error of the moon; She comes more nearer earth than she was wont And makes men mad.
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian Call'd Roderigo.
Roderigo kill'd?
And Cassio kill'd?
No, Cassio is not kill'd.
Not Cassio kill'd!
Then murder 's out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
O, falsely, falsely murdered!
Alas, what cry is that?
That?
what?
Out, and alas!
That was my lady's voice.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!
A guiltless death I die.
O, who hath done this deed?
Nobody; I myself.
O, farewell!
Why, how should she be murdered?
Alas, who knows?
You heard her say herself, it was not I.
O, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
She was false as water.
Thou art rash as fire, to say That she was false.
O, she was heavenly true!
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.
Thy husband knew it all.
My husband!
Thy husband.
That she was false to wedlock?
Ay, with Cassio.
Nay, had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I'ld not have sold her for it.
My husband!
My husband?
What needs this iteration, woman?
I say thy husband.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!
He, woman; I say thy husband.
Dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day!
He lies to the heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
Ha!
Peace, you were best.
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt.
O gull!
O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed— I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known, Though I lost twenty lives.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!
Murder, murder!
What is the matter?
How now, general?
O, are you come, Iago?
You have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck.
What is the matter?
Speak, for my heart is full.
I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true.
But did you ever tell him she was false?
I did.
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie; Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!
She false with Cassio?
Did you say with Cassio?
With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.
O heavens forfend!
And your reports have set the murder on.
Tis a strange truth.
O monstrous act!
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think upon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!
What, are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
O!
O!
O!
Nay, lay thee down and roar; For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye.
O, she was foul!
I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece, Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.
I know this act shows horrible and grim.
Poor Desdemon!
I saw it in his hand: It was a handkerchief, an antique token My father gave my mother.
O heaven!
O heavenly powers!
Hold your peace.
Twill out, 'twill.
I peace!
Be wise, and get you home.
I will not.
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
O thou dull Moor!
That handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband; For often with a solemn earnestness, More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle, He begg'd of me to steal it.
Villainous whore!
She give it Cassio?
No, alas, I found it, And I did give't my husband.
Filth, thou liest!
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb!
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife?
Are there not stones in heaven But what serve for thunder?
Precious villain!
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
Ay, ay!
O, lay me by my mistress’ side.
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
Tis a notorious villain.
I'll after that same villain, For 'tis a damned slave.
I am not valiant neither, But every puny whipster gets my sword.
But why should honor outlive honesty?
Let it go all.
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me?
I will play the swan, And die in music.
Sings.
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor; So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true; So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Uncle, I must come forth.
If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
Look in upon me then, and speak with me, Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
What is the matter?
Behold, I have a weapon; A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh.
I have seen the day That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop.
But, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate?
Tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; Here is my journey's end, here is my butt And very seamark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd?
Tis a lost fear: Man but a rush against Othello's breast, And he retires.
Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now?
O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock!
When we shall meet at compt, This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, And fiends will snatch at it.
O cursed, cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds!
Roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemon!
dead, Desdemon!
dead!
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
Where is that viper?
Bring the villain forth.
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
Wrench his sword from him.
I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
I am not sorry neither.
I'ld have thee live, For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
O thou Othello, that wert once so good, What shall be said to thee?
Why, anything; An honorable murderer, if you will, For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
Ay.
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demidevil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
From this time forth I never will speak word.
What, not to pray?
Torments will ope your lips.
Well, thou dost best.
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, Which, as I think, you know not.
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, And here another.
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo.
O villain!
Most heathenish and most gross!
Now here's another discontented paper, Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; But that, belike, Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him.
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife's?
I found it in my chamber; And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.
O fool!
fool!
fool!
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his.
You shall close prisoner rest, Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state.
Come, bring away.
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that.
I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought, Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, Albeit unused to the melting mood, Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum.
Set you down this; And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcised dog And smote him, thus.
O bloody period!
All that's spoke is marr'd.
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee.
No way but this, Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; For he was great of heart.
O Spartan dog, More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
Look on the tragic loading of this bed; This is thy work.
The object poisons sight; Let it be hid.
Gratiano, keep the house, And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, For they succeed on you.
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate. 
Good, speak to the mariners.
Bestir Heigh, my hearts!
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Yare, yare!
Take in the topsail.
Tend to the Master's whistle!
Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
Where's the Master?
To the Mariners] Play the men!
To the Mariners] Play the I pray now, keep below.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
Do you not hear him?
Nay, good, be patient.
When the sea is.
Hence!
What cares these roarers for the name of the king?
Trouble us not.
Good, yet remember whom thou has aboard.
None that I more love than myself.
You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority.
I have great comfort from this fellow.
Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows.
Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging.
Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage.
If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
Down with the topmast!
Yare!
Lower, lower!
A cry within] A plague [A cry within] A plague upon this howling!
What do you here?
Shall we give o'er and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?
A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
Work you, then.
Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noise- maker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
All lost!
To prayers, to prayers!
All lost!
What, must our mouths be cold?
The king and prince at prayers!
Let's assist them, For our case is theirs.
I'm out of patience.
He'll be hanged yet, Though every drop of water swear against it, And gape at wid'st to glut him.
Mercy on us!’—‘We split, we split!’—‘Farewell, my wife and children!’—‘Farewell, brother!’—‘We split, we split, we split!’ Let's all sink wi'th’ King.
Let's take leave of him.
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground—long heath, brown furze, anything.
If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin's cheek, Dashes the fire out.
Poor souls, the perished.
Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her.
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father.
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Tis time I should inform thee farther.
Lend thy hand, And pluck my magic garment from me.—So: [Lays down his cloak] [Lays down his cloak] Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry, which though saw'st sink.
Sit down; For thou must now know farther.
You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding ‘Stay, not yet.’ The hour's now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear, Obey, and be attentive.
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.
Certainly, sir, I can.
By what?
Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants.
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me?
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.
But how is it That this lives in thy mind?
What seest thou else In the dark backward and abyss of time?
If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here, How thou cam'st here thou mayst.
But that I do not.
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir And princess no worse issued.
O, the heavens!
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessèd was't we did?
Both, both, my girl.
By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither.
Please you, farther.
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee mark me, that a brother should Be so perfidious—he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.
Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?
Sir, most heedfully.
O good sir, I do.
I pray thee mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'er prized all popular rate, in my false brother Awakened an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood, in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound.
He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the duke; out o'th’ substitution, And executing the outward face of royalty With all prerogative; hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for; he needs will be Absolute Milan.
Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates— So dry he was for sway—with the King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom, yet unbowed alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping.
O the heavens!
Mark his condition and th’event; then tell me If this might be a brother.
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; Which was that he, in lieu o'th’ premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan, With all the honours, on my brother; whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and, i'th’ dead of darkness, The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self.
Alack, for pity!
I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't.
Hear a little further, And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon's; without the which this story Were most impertinent.
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?
Well demanded, wench; My tale provokes that question.
There they hoist us, To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong.
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!
O, a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me.
Thou didst smile, Infused with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burden groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach, to bear up Against what should ensue.
How came we ashore?
By Providence divine.
Some food we had, and some fresh water, that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity,—who being then appointed Master of this design,—did give us; with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentelness Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.
Would I might But ever see that man!
Here in this island we arrived, and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princesess’ can, that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Heavens thank you for't.
And now I pray you, sir— For still ’tis beating in my mind,—your reason For raising this sea-storm.
Know thus far north.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop.
I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come!
I come To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?
To every article.
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason?
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation.
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the King's son Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leapt, cried, ’Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.’ Why, that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
Close by, my master.
But are they, Ariel, safe?
Not a hair perished; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before; and as thou bad'st me, In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.
The King's son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.
Of the King's ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o'th’ fleet.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed; but there's more work.
What is the time o'th’ day?
Past the mid season.
At least two glasses.
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Is there more toil?
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.
How now?
Moody?
What is't thou canst demand?
My liberty.
Before the time be out?
No more!
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.
Thou did promise To bate me a full year.
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?
No.
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o'th’ earth When it is baked with frost.
I do not, sir.
Thou liest, malignant thing!
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?
Hast thou forgot her?
No, sir.
Thou hast.
Where was she born?
Speak; tell me.
Sir, in Algiers.
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget'st.
This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Algiers Thou know'st was banished—for one thing she did They would not take her life.
Is not this true?
Ay, sir.
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by th’ sailors.
Then was this island— Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp, hag-born—not honoured with A human shape.
Yes, Caliban her son.
Dull thing, I say so: he, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service.
I thank thee, master.
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.
That's my noble master!
What shall I do?
Go take this shape, And hither come in't: go; hence with diligence!
Exit Ariel] [Exit Ariel] Awake, dear heart, awake!
Thou hast slept well; Awake.
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me.
Shake it off.
Come on; We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer.
Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us.
There's wood enough within.
When?
Fine apparition!
My lord, it shall be done.
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both!
A south-west blow on ye And blister you all o'er!
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou tak'st from me.
All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king, and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o‘th’ island.
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!
I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child.
Would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans.
Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel, and be quick, thou'rt best, To answer other business.—Shrug'st thou, malice?
So, slave, hence!
sings] [sings] Come unto these yellow sands, And than take hands; Curtsied when you have and the kissed— The wild waves whist— Foot it featly here and there, And, sweet sprites, bear The burden.
Hark, hark!
dispersedly] Bow-wow!
Hark, hark!
I'th’ air or th’ earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon Some god o'th’ island.
No, it begins again.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Ding dong.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes.—I hear it now above me.
What is't?
A spirit?
Lord, how it looks about!
He hath lost his fellows, And strays about to find ’em I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
Aside] It goes on, I see, [Aside] As my soul prompts it.
to Ariel] Spirit, fine spirit, I—II free [to Ariel] Spirit, fine spirit, I—II free thee Within two days for this.
No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid.
My language!
How?
The best?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.
He does hear me, And that he does I weep; myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The King my father wrecked.
Alack, for mercy!
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain.
Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently?
This [Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently?
Soft, sir!
One word more.
to Ferdinand] One word more; I [to Ferdinand] One word more; I charge thee That thou attend me.
Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow'st not; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on't.
No, as I am a man.
Follow.
No; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power.
What, I say, My foot my tutor?
Hang not on my garments.
Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety.
Silence!
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.
Hush!
To th’ most of men this is a Caliban, And they to him are angels.
to Ariel] Thou shalt be free [to Ariel] Thou shalt be free As mountain winds; but then exactly do All points of my command.
Prithee, peace.
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
to Alonso] Sir,— [to Alonso] Sir,— [to Antonio] One: tell.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
to Alonso] Therefore, my lord,— [to Alonso] Therefore, my lord,— [to Sebastian] Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his [to Sebastian] Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
to Gonzalo] I prithee, spare.
The old cock.
The cockerel.
The wager?
A laughter.
A match!
to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be [to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be desert,— [to Sebastian] Ha, ha, ha!
So, you're paid.
Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible— [to Antonio] Yet— [to Antonio] Yet— Yet— [to Sebastian] He could not miss't.
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
to Sebastian] Temperance was a delicate wench.
to Sebastian] Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.
to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most [to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
to Sebastian] True, save means to live.
to Sebastian] True, Of that there's none, or little.
to Adrian] How lush and lusty the grass looks!
to Adrian] How lush and How green!
The ground indeed is tawny.
With an eye of green in't.
He misses not much.
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.
to Adrian] But the rarity of it is, which is indeed [to Adrian] But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit— [to Antonio] As many vouched rarities are.
to Antonio] As many [to Adrian] That our garments, being, as they were, [to Adrian] That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.
to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak, [to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as [to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
Not since widow Dido's time.
Widow?
A pox o'that!
How came that widow in?
Widow Dido!
to Gonzalo] ‘Widow Dido’ said you?
You make me study of that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Carthage?
I assure you, Carthage.
to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous [to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous harp.
He hath raised the wall, and houses too.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
to Adrian] Ay.
to Adrian] [to Sebastian] Why, in good time.
to Sebastian] Why, in good time.
to Alonso] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem [to Alonso] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is not queen.
And the rarest that e'er came there.
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
O, widow Dido!
Ay, widow Dido.
to Alonso] Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day [to Alonso] Is not, sir, my I wore it?
I mean, in a sort.
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.
Would I have never Married my daughter there!
For, coming thence, My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her.
No, no; he's gone.
to Alonso] Sir, you may thank yourself for this [to Alonso] Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African, Where she, at least, is banished from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Prithee, peace.
You were kneeled to an importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o'th’ beam should bow.
So is the dear'st o'th’ loss.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in—you rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster.
Very well.
And most chirurgeonly.
to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all, good sir, [to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy.
Very foul.
to Alonso] Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,— [to Alonso] Had I [to Sebastian] He'd sow't with nettle-seed.
to Sebastian] He'd sow't with Or docks, or mallows.
And were the king on't, what would I do?
I'th’ commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things, for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty— [to Antonio] Yet he would be king on't.
to Antonio] No marrying ’mong his subjects?
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern, sir, [to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern, sir, T'excel the golden age.
Save his majesty!
Long live Gonzalo!
I do well believe your highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
Twas you we laughed at.
Who, in this kind of merry fooling, am nothing to you; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still.
What a blow was there given!
An it had not fallen flat-long.
You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.
We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.. [to Gonzalo] Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
to Gonzalo] Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discre- tion so weakly.
Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?
Go sleep, and hear us.
I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find They are inclined to do so.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety.
Thank you.
Wondrous heavy.
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
It is the quality o'th’ climate.
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent; They dropped, as by a thunder-stroke.
Do you not hear me speak?
I do; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep.
What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep.
Noble Sebastian, Thou let'st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink'st Whiles thou art waking.
Thou dost snore distinctly; There's meaning in thy snores.
Well, I am standing water.
I'll teach you how to flow.
Do so: to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me.
O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it; how in stripping it.
You more invest it!
Ebbing men, indeed, Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth.
Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded— For he's a spirit of persuasion, only Professes to persuade—the king his son's alive, ’Tis as impossible that he's undrowned As he that sleeps here swims.
I have no hope That he's undrowned.
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there.
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?
He's gone.
Then, tell me, Who's the next heir of Naples?
Claribel.
How say you?
Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions There is some space.
There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat.
O, that you bore The mind that I do!
what a sleep were this For your advancement!
Do you understand me?
Methinks I do.
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?
For all the rest, They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent: as thou got'st Milan, I'll come by Naples.
Draw thy sword—one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest, And I the King shall love thee.
Draw together, And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo.
Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] [Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware.
Now, good angels Preserve the King.
waking] Why, how now?
Ho, awake!
waking] Why, how now?
to Gonzalo] Wherefore this What's the matter?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
I heard nothing.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
Lead off this ground, and let's make further search For my poor son.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is sure i'th’ island.
Lead away.
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him By inch-meal disease!
A noise of thunder heard] [A noise of thunder heard] His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse.
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly, I'll fall flat.
Perchance he will not mind me.
A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not- of-the-newest Poor-John.
A strange fish!
When they will not give a dolt to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.
Legged like a man, and his fins like arms!
Warm o'my troth!
I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.
Thunder] [Thunder] Alas, the storm is come again!
I will here, shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
What's the matter?
Have we devils here?
I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, ‘As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground.’ And it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at nostrils.
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I tak it, an ague.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest.
Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.
Come.
Caliban drinks] Amen!
I will pour some in [Caliban drinks] thy other mouth.
Stephano!
Doth thy other mouth call me?
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth.
He pulls Trinculo out from under Caliban's cloak by the legs] Thou art very Trinculo indeed!
How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf?
can he vent Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?
I hope now thou art not drowned.
Is the storm overblown?
I hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm.
And art thou living, Stephano?
O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
to Trinculo] How didst thou ’scape?
How cam'st thou hither?
Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither.
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard—by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
Here, kiss the book.
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
Out o'th’ moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'th’ moon when time was.
The man i'th’ moon?
I'll show thee every fertile inch o'th’ island; And I will kiss thy foot.
I prithee, be my god.
Come on then; down, and swear.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.
A most scurvy monster!
I could find in my heart to beat him— Come, kiss.
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts, Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset, I'll bring thee To clustering filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee Young sea-mews from the rock.
Wilt thou go with me?
sings drunkenly] Farewell, master, farewell, farewell!
No more dams I'll make for fish Nor fetch in firing At requiring, Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish ’Ban, ’Ban, Cacaliban Has a new master—get a new man!
Freedom high-day!
High-day, freedom!
Freedom, high-day, freedom!
O brave monster!
Lead the way. 
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures.
O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, And he's composed of harshness.
I forget, But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busil'est, when I do it.
O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do.
If you'll sit down I'll bear your logs the while.
Pray, give me that; I'll carry it to the pile.
It would become me As well as it does you; and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it, And yours it is against.
aside] Poor worm, thou art infected!
You look wearily.
No, noble mistress, ’tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night.
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?
Miranda.
O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration, worth What's dearest to the world!
But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature's best!
But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father's precepts I therein do forget.
Do you love me?
I, Beyond all limit of what else i'th’ world, Do love, prize, honour you.
weeping] I am a fool [weeping] I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.
aside] Fair encounter [aside] Fair encounter Of two most rare affections!
Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ’em!
Wherefore weep you?
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.
But this is trifling, And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows.
Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me.
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow You may deny me, but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no.
My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever.
My husband then?
Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't, and now farewell Till half an hour hence.
A thousand thousand!
I'll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining. 
Servant-monster?
The folly of this island!
They say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th'other two be brained like us, the state totters.
Where should they be set else?
He were a brave mon- ster indeed, if they were set in his tail My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack.
By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.
Your lieutenant, if you list, he's no standard.
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither.
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.
How does thy honour?
Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day?
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?
to Stephano] Lo, how he mocks me!
Wilt thou let him, my lord?
Bite him to death, I [to Stephano] Lo, lo, again!
Bite him to death, I prithee.
The poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
Thou liest.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
Why, I said nothing.
Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll server thee.
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?
Thou liest; thou canst not.
What a pied ninny's this!
Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o'doors and make a stockfish of thee.
Why, what did I?
I did nothing.
I'll go farther off.
Didst thou not say he lied?
Thou liest.
Do I so?
Take thou that.
Beating Trinculo] As you like [Beating Trinculo] As you like this, give me the lie another time.
Ha, ha, ha!
Beat him enough; after a little time I'll beat him too.
to Trinculo] Stand farther.
Remember First to possess his books, for without them He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command—they all do hate him As rootedly as I.
Is it so brave as lass?
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?
Excellent.
Ay, on mine honour.
Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Flout ’em and scout ’em, And scout ’em and flout ’em Thought is free.
That's not the tune.
What is this same?
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
O, forgive me my sins!
Art thou afeared?
No, monster, not I.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked I cried to dream again.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.
He lays it on.
Wilt come?
I'll follow, Stephano. 
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness, To th’ dulling of my spirits.
Sit down and rest.
Well, let him go.

aside to Antonio] The next advantage [aside to Antonio] The next advantage Will we take throughly.
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!
Marvellous sweet music!
Give us kind keepers, heavens!
What were these?
A living drollery.
Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.
If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me’ If I should say I saw such islanders?
For certes these are people of the island, Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any.
aside] Honest lord, [aside] Honest lord, Thou hast said well, for some of you there present Are worse than devils.
aside] Praise in departing.
aside] They vanished strangely.
Not I.
Faith, sir, you need not fear.
When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em Wallets of flesh?
Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts?
Which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of.
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny, That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island Where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men Being most unfit to live.
I have made you mad, And even with suchlike valour men hang and drown Their proper selves.
You fools!
If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted.
But remember, For that's my business to you, that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero; Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed, The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace.
I'th’ name of something holy sir, why stand you In this strange stare?
Therefore my son i'th’ ooze is bedded, and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded, And with him there lie mudded.
But one fiend at a time, I'll fight their legions o'er.
I'll be thy second.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly, And hinder them from this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
to Ferdinand] If I have too austerely punished you, [to Ferdinand] If I have too Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life— Or that for which I live—who once again I tender to thy hand.
I do believe it Against an oracle.
What, Ariel!
My industrious servant, Ariel!
What would my potent master?
Here I am.
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick.
Presently?
Ay, with a twink.
Before you can say ‘Come’ and ‘Go,’ And breathe twice and cry ‘So, so,’ Each one, tripping on his toe Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master?
No?
Dearly, my delicate Ariel.
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.
Well, I conceive.
I warrant you, sir; The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.
Appear and pertly!
No tongue, all eyes!
Be silent.
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
A contract of true love to celebrate; And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers.
Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen.
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn.
Of her society Be not afraid.
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and miad, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted—but in vain.
High'st queen of state, Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
How does my bounteous sister?
Go with me To bless this twain, that they may Prospus be And honoured in their issue.
Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, Long continuance, and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you!
Juno sings her blessings upon you.
Earth's increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty, Vines and clust'ring bunches growing, Plants and goodly burden bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you, Ceres’ blessing so is on you.
Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines call'd to enact My present fancies.
Sweet now, silence!
Your nymphs, called naiads of the wandering brooks, With your sedged crowns and over-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons; Juno does command.
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow and be merry; Make holiday, your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.
to the spirits] Well done!
no more!
These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind.
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
We wish your peace.
Thy thoughts I cleave to.
What's thy pleasure?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Say again: where didst thou leave these variets?
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project.
This was well done, my bird.
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost, And, as with age his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers.
I will plague them all, Even to roaring.
Come, hang them on this line.
Monster, you fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you— Thou wert but a lost monster.
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour.
Prithee, my king, be quiet.
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker.

O peer!
O worthy Stephano!
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

Thy grace shall have it.
The dropsy drown this fool!
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage?
Let't alone, And do the murder first.
If he awake, From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.
I will have none on't.
We shall lose our time, And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes With foreheads villanous low.
Go to, carry this.

Hark, they roar!
Let them be hunted soundly.
How's the day?
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.
I did say so When first I raised the tempest.
Say, my spirit, How fares the King and's followers?
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir In the lime-grove which weather-fends your cell; They cannot budge till your release.
Dost thou think so, spirit?
Mine would, sir, were I human.
Go release them, Ariel.
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, And they shall be themselves.
I'll fetch them, sir.
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves, And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimmed The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war—to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth By my so potent art.

I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat.
All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement Inhabits here.
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!

to Antonio] For you, most wicked sir, whom to call [to Antonio] For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore.
If thou beest Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wrecked upon this shore; where I have lost— How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— My dear son Ferdinand.
I am woe for't, sir.
Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure.
I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content.
You the like loss?
As great to me as late; and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.
A daughter?
When did you lose your daughter?
In this last tempest.
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, these words Are natural breath.
But howsoe'er you have Been jostled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very Duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed To be the lord on't.
No more yet of this, For ‘tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting.
Here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad.
Pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder to content ye As much as me my dukedom.
Sweet lord, you play me false.
No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world.
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play.
If this prove A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.
A most high miracle.
Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise and say how thou cam'st here.
O wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!
O brave new world That has such people in't!
Tis new to thee.
to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou [to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal providence she's mine.
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Received a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me.
I am hers.
But O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!
I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this.
I say amen, Gonzalo!
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples?
O rejoice Beyond a common joy!
And set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of ourselves, When no man was his own [to Ferdinand and Miranda] Give me your hands.
Be it so!
Amen!
Here is more of us!
I prophesied if a gallows were on land This fellow could not drown.
to the Boatswain] Now, [to the Boatswain] Now, blasphemy, That swear'st grace o'erboard: not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land?
What is the news?
The best news is that we have safely found Our King and company; the next, our ship, Which but three glasses since we gave out split, Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.

If I did think, sir, I were well awake I'd strive to tell you.
aside to Ariel] Bravely, my diligence.
Thou shalt be free.
to Alonso] How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not.
Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune.
Coragio, bully- monster, coragio!
If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly sight.
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is!
I am afraid He will chastise me.
Ha, ha!
