I am sorry you will leave my father like that.
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil, robbed it of some tediousness.
And Launcelot, you will see Lorenzo soon at supper.
Give him this letter.
Goodbye!
If a Christian does not play the knave and get you, I am very wrong.
But goodbye.
These foolish drops drown my manly spirit.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, good Launcelot.
What a heinous sin I am having to be ashamed of being my fatherâ€™s child.
Even though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners.
If you keep your promise, I will end this fight and become a Christian and your loving wife.
