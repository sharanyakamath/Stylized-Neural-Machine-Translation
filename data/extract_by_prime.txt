I am sorry you leave my father like that.
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil, robbed it of some tedious work.
And Launcelot, you will soon be able to see Lorenzo at supper.
Give him this letter.
Farewell!
If a Christian does not play the knave and get you, I am very wrong.
But goodbye.
These foolish drops drown my manly spirit.
Farewell.
Farewell, Launcelot.
What a heinous sinner I am having to be ashamed of being my fatherâ€™s child.
I am a daughter of his, but I do not like his manners.
Oh, Lorenzo, if you keep your promise, I will end this fight, become a Christian and marry you.
