# Stylized-Neural-Machine-Translation

In this project, we are interested in neural machine translation of text followed by style transfer to convert archaic Shakespearean texts into formally correct modern English. We will be implementing two models - an NMT and a text style transfer model, and perform iterative bidirectional knowledge transfer between these two models so that they learn from each other. 

In this project we have trained 5 models

1. Baseline
2. translator
3. pre-trained-formality-transfer-main
4. augmented-data-translator
5. StylizedNMT
