I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.
Give him this letter.
Adieu!
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
But adieu.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
Adieu.
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners.
O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
