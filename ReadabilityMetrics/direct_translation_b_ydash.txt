Come with naked swords.
Come you with â€œknocking at the gateâ€?
Come and bring Messala with you, immediately to us.
He says, â€œTarry, my cousin Suffolk.
And cross-gartered?
Death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
Did I depart from there in rage?
Didnâ€™t she herself retorn me there?
Didnâ€™t they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me to give it to you?
Did they ask you to tell her about it, madam?
Did you leave him in this contemplation?
Did you see the handkerchief?
And die in music.
And that is why?
Viola died that day when she died from her birth.
And discourse fustian with oneâ€™s shadow?
Do it with all your heart.
Do it, by these pickers and stealers.
Do you now strew flowers in Pompeyâ€™s way that comes in triumph over Pompeyâ€™s blood?
Does affection breed it?
You are right, sir, but she will be able to excuse why the doors are made against you.
When mercy seasons justice, earthly power will show like Godâ€™s.
I will make her render her page to me.
I love you the more.
And now, this house, these servants, and this same myself are yours, my lord.
He will ever love him dearly, and he will always be a good friend.
Every object that could make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad.
She is fair, if that is true.
They are good.
I am false.
I am alone and I am very happy with your love for you.
He fixed his eyes on you.
For Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
For his cowardship, ask Fabian.
I wonder if he is so simple to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers.
I will keep my house, Fit, in my house to instruct her youth.
For my part, I do not want to laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
For my love, I pray you donâ€™t know what I am doing.
I will be able to make sure they are so good, they will go far with little.
My name of George begins with his thought that I am him.
For my sister and her princely sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, which, as you know, must be spilt in unjust way.
I promise you that I will be as good as my word.
For the Jewâ€™s bond that he has of me, let it not enter your mind of love.
For the better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but I am the weaver.

For the sake of them you are sorrowful for, do me the favor to dilate at full what has happened to them and you.
Let this acceptance take place in your fair minds.
Three months.
And friends with Caesar.
From here I will make all these doubts even more clear.
When you are over-earning with your Brutus, he will think your mother chides you and leave you so.
We are a huge fan of her womb children, many for many virtues excellent, none but for some and yet all different.
From your hated presence, I do so.
God forbids you, dear and faithful lord, to wear, wrest, or bow your reading, or to charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate, whose right is not in native colors with the truth.
It will never be seen again of eyes so royal!
Good monsieur, do not let the honey bag break.
Hast du challenged you?
He has given his praises to his speech, my lord, with almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Have we not been able to do anything, do we have a desire for sport, and do we have a desire for a skepticism, as men?
Have mercy too!
After we brought our treasure where we will, we take him down and turn him off, like a sleeve, to shake his ears and graze in commons.
He promised us to follow up to the temple.
He is a paramour for a sweet voice.
He who has commanded is our king.
He will not follow Bourbon now, let him go, and with his cap in hand, like a base pander, hold the chamber door, while by a slave, no gentler than my dog, his fairest daughter is
He is gone.
Her sister is poisoned by her.
I am here, and wood in this wood, because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Here he stands.
I am a man who is condemned and excused.
I am so glad you did.
Here is my mistress.
Here is your state: either be gone before the watch is set, or by the break of day disguised from hence.
Here will be my rest.
Here is a wonderful place to perform.
Hereâ€™s another, who has a slammed look proclaiming what she is making on her heart.
Here is another, Writ in my cousinâ€™s hand, stol'n from her pocket, containing her affection to Benedick.
He is a kinsman.
His kiss is as sanctified as the touch of bread.
He must be jealous of Cassioâ€™s smiles, gestures, and light behavior.
How do you do it out?
How do you get here?
How does your content make you happy?
How does she do it?
How do you feel like you, Master Touchstone?
How long is that, think you?
How was that ta'en up?
I know you may be converted, but I think you look with your eyes as you do with other women.
I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!
I am sick when I do not look at you.
If my hair does not tickle me, I must scratch.
I am witnessing her doing it.
I am Rosalind.
I was so weary with disasters, tugging with fortune, that I would set my life on any chance, to stop it or be riddled on a whim.
I am another.
I love Hastings with my heart.
I beg you to come back tomorrow.
I beg you to visit my too much changÃ¨d son.
I believe your Majesty does not take any scorn to wear the leek on Saint Tavyâ€™s day.
I hope you have good days and long to see.
I know that they stay for me on Pompeyâ€™s porch.
I do not doubt that they say, â€œIt is a sweet comedy.â€
I think she is thirty.
I think that this brain of mine is not the trail of policy so sure it is as good as it used to be.
I love her with a smile.
I am for Ganymede.
I am for no woman.
I am for Rosalind.
I have been trying to avoid him all day.
I have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for Richardâ€™s soul.
I have heard Apollodorus carry it, and what, I pray you?
I have met a gentleman who promised me to help me to another musician, a fine musician, to instruct our mistress.
I have reason for it.
I will go in my best interest.
I know not what is spent in the search.
If law, authority, and power refuse to do so, it will go hard with poor Antonio.
I have mine.
I must be from there!
I must then take all the pirates out of Rome to send me wheat measures.
I pray God will give them a fair departure.
Now, tell me, for which of my bad parts did you fall in love with me first?
I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cowâ€™s smears that she had milked.
I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and gave her them again, saying, â€œWear these for my sake.â€ We who are true lovers run into strange cap
I serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs on the green.
I will love you.
I trow this is his house.
I was going to your hotel, Cassio.
I will cleanse your mortal grossness so that you will go like a savage spirit.
I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke.
I am with him.
I would find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, because I love none.
I am satisfied with you, and I have paid for it.
I would kill a thousand people if I did not do it.
I, my lord.
I am my royal sovereign.
I.
I.
I will be wise hereafter and seek grace.
I will go to bed at noon.
I will sleep.
I will stay, to have you forget, forge any other home but this.
If I can, I will find those who will.
If it does not work, you may conceal her, as best she can, in some reclusive and religious life.
If it stands, as you do, in honor of your honor, be assured that my purse, my person, my extremist means, will be a great asset to your occasion.
If he does not deserve it on earth, he will never come to heaven.
If you are a mountaineer, let them throw millions of acres on us, till our ground, chanting his pate against the burning zone, make Ossa like a wart!
If you do not want to give your poor servant one favor at your gracious hand, you will forever confirm his happiness.
If our navy continues to grow, I have an absolute hope that our landmen will stand up.
If you leave me, you do me wrong.
If you wrongly do, will we not be revenge?
If your love can labor in a sad invention, hang her an epitaph on her tomb and sing it to her bones.
I will be doing it in assemblies.
In good time, here comes the sweating lord.
In good time, the lieutenant comes here.
In good time, here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.
You may say, â€œnot well.
In the midst of the slums of youth, the worst of the worst is a series of swollen blasts.
I will bring you to your ship and so to Naples, where I hope to see the nuptial of these dear-beloved solemnized.
In the morning, we will both fly towards Belmont.
I am sure Lorenzo is not.
I became my guide, led him, begged for him, and saved him from despair.
It is the marrow and the marrow of our attribute.
My lord, the wretched animal sat in such a groan that his coat slid fast to bursting and the tears shook his innocent nose.
Isnâ€™t it not damning to let this canker of our nature come into further evil?
Is he a man who will meet Tybalt?
Is it not a sweet goose?
Is it physically to walk unbracÃ©d and suck up the humors of the morning?
Is that the case?
Isnâ€™t the grease of a mutton as healthy as the sweat of a man?
It is marvellous that he has a better hour, for lovers to run ever before the clock.
It is very regrettable, Brutus, that you have no mirrors that will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye so you can see your shadow.
He would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.
Joy comes in such a needy time.
Now you know it: the senate has concluded to give Caesar a crown today.
Then he laid the love juice on some true loveâ€™s sight.
You will soon, at supper, see Lorenzo, who is your new masterâ€™s guest.
He may claim a pound of flesh to be cut off near the merchantâ€™s heart.
Leave you out?
Leave us, Publius, so that the people who rushe on us will do some mischief.
Let her speak of me before her father.
Let him hold his fingers so, and Pyramus and Thisbe will whisper through that cranny.
Let him ply his music.
Let his knights have colder looks among you.
Let my liver heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Let no man follow this act, but we the doers.
Let our hearts, as subtle masters, stir up their servants to a rage and after seem to chide 'em.
Let the wise man fly.
Let those who play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, because there will be some of them who will laugh to make some barren spectators laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play should be
Let us do it with no fear, no, with no fear, and nothing more than if we heard that England was busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.
Let us swear by our resolution.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Look for it to be done with kindness.
When I am king, you are king, and all the moveables where my brother was possessed.
You get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen, good my lord, for on that ground I will make a holy descant.
Look, where Publius is coming to fetch me.
The absence of lovers is more tedious than the dial eightscore times.
You made your other love Demetrius, who even but now did not spur me with his foot, call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, precious, celestial?
I love it.
And make him break his faith with fair gles, with Ariadne and Antiopa?
Can young men not die as well as old?
You are a master of your art.
How?
You will be happy, through all the world.
Oh, Lord!
I have a hundred and forty.
I will.
I am a little stale.
I will be mine, to eke out hers.
Mine, two hundred.
Most chirurgeonly.
And dear actors, do not eat onions or garlic, because we are to utter sweet breath.
Most poor matters are rich.
Is she dying for this?
Do they all have to be hanged that swear and lie?
And my heart too.
I will help you.
My trust, like a good parent, shook him up as much as I was, and he was not bound by it.
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
Both men and masters would not take aught.
He never could keep his part, but in the force of his will.
Never, since the middle summerâ€™s spring, met us on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, by a pavÃ¨d fountain, or by a brook, or in the beachâ€™s 
You are not a jot of â€œTranioâ€ in your mouth.
Nothing is at a like goodness still.
Now about the cauldron sing like elves and fairies in a ring, enchanting all that you put in.
Now you will be able to tell your story.
Now I think about it, she first told me you were mad, then came in smiling, and in such forms that were presupposed here.
Now that I have the boy, I will remove this horrible imperfection of her eyes.
I will do it.
Now I think I have a mind to it.
Now they are re-stripping their backward course, bearing with frank appearance their intentions toward Cyprus.
Now to our French causes.
Who knows you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
Now you know my meaning.
Now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars and soldiers, give me one poor request.
Now, I pray you, sir, for you, you are the reason for raising this sea storm.
O you mortal engines, who are whose rude throats are counterfeited by the immortal Joveâ€™s dead, please, thank you!
The heat of the ginger.
And of women.
I will find a good cause to work on that vice in him.
On the answer, he pays you as sure as your feet hit the ground they step on.
One Deformed is one of them.
Only in that safety she died her brothers.
You do me more wrong now than if you had wasted all I have.
I will get to these cudgeled scars, and swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
It is a shame to have the general wrong of Rome, as fire drives out fire, so pity to have done this on Caesar.

And yet, you say that exile is not death.
I am a second father.
Isnâ€™t I ever told you something different?
Will I have hell?
Will our bloody blood, spirited with wine, be swollen?
You will, or some of us will, be smart for it.
I will, sir.
She is so in love, she is less likely to meet her new beloved anywhere.
She can weep, sir.
She goes down at twelve.
She is exceedingly sceptical.
She is mine, and all my right of her is my estate to Demetrius.
I love her.
She is obedient, very obedient.â€”Proceed you in your tears.â€” Concerning this, sir.
Since the dispute will not bear color for what he is, you should be able to do so by saying that what he is is, augmented, would run to these and these extremities.
Since you know you cannot see yourself as well as by reflection, I will, your glass, be able to find out what you are talking about.
And smelt it?
Good, madam.
So adieu, sir.
I am for no woman.
I am for Rosalind.
I would be sane.
I am, being a man of faith, obligated to call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
I did.
I am lieutenant.
I do.
Mine.
So falls it out with Rivers, Vaughan, Grey
I am glad it did, as I sat down with them and I think it is a sport.
I have 'nared an Athenianâ€™s eyes', and I have been so blameless.
You will be happy.
So far, Signior Lucentio.
You may stay, because I have more to share with Bianca.
Good morning to you every one.
I would have done so, but for fashion sake, I thank you for your society.
Mine was.
I have been to me.
He fell.
He goes to heaven.
I am.
I will catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.

It is.
It is.
He is my gracious madam.
And so of men.
He is so perchanced.
Return to you, and nothing else?
I say that.
She did.
She is cousin.
I swear.
The lion disappeared.
So they are.
They were slain.
We will, if he wins her.
I will.
I will.
So, adieu.
God is with him!
Good Capulet, which is the name I tender as dearly as my own, will be satisfied.
He is a snagged man.
So, pray you, call Beatrice.
Oh my lord, adieu.
With no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
I hold it right, without any circumstance, that we shake hands and take part.
Some have greatness thrust upon them.
He dreams of a new life.
I bob and bob her withered dewlap over her head.
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
And speak again, my lord.
And speak parrot?
And squabble?
You are always in love and service.
Stay, Nurse.
I am more than happy to make the loss worse than you may call to comfort you, because I have lost my daughter.
Take good note of what Caesar does, what suitors press to him.
Tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale you are here from Verona?
Tell the Dauphin that his jest will be a little shallow when thousands of people weep more than they laughed at it.
He lost his father.
And that is the case of Cawdor.
That distilled by magic sleights will raise such artificial sprites as will draw him to his confusion.
I am he, let me show it a little even in this case: I was constant Cimber, and I should be banished.
That is Claudio.
What is most important to consider is the beauty of his daughter.
He hurls on you for false forswearing and for murder.
That was enough to hang us all.
He should have done everything he should, because he is given to sports, to wildness and to much company.
He does it under the name of love, as who should say if I sleep or eat, 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
That would be a good thing for you!
That is not a healthy food, they say.
That is true too.
The best thing about me is diligence.
The business you have done here cannot be without you, especially the business of Cleopatra, which is entirely dependent on your home.

He is a man with a good capon lined belly, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut, full of wise saws and modern instances.
The moon will be able to bow like a silver bow in heaven.
As soon as we have ta'en the sacrament, we will unite the white rose and the red.

It is a sensible tale.
Give it a welcome as a stranger.
We must be able to measure twenty miles today.
Is he idle?
Love is said to be a child, because he is so oft beguiled by choice.
It is a blind, a blind Cupid.
Tell me, Katherine, how fair you will be.
So, we will come.
Good news, Grumio.
I pray you, news.
So, like herself, wise, fair and true, she will be placÃ¨d in my constant soul.
Since I cannot prove a lover to entertain these fairly well-spoken days, I am a determinant to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
It was that the man was mad.
She is asking for warnings and warnings and warnings and warnings for imminent evils, and on her knee Hath begged me to stay at home today.
You are a character.
They are gone.

They have conspired together.
They are the ones who are most disgusted with my folly.
This cuff was just to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.

This report has a king so exasperated that he is ready for some war.
This is the same progeny of evils that comes from our debate, from our dissension.

That is the case.
I will go straight to visit him.
Who leaves their valiant bones in France, dripping like men though buried in your dunghills, will be famed
You must make a dullard of the world, if they didnâ€™t think the profits of my death were very pregnant and potential spirits would make you want it.
You are not in heaven.
You, all-shaking thunder, smit the thick rotundity o' th' world, crack natureâ€™s molds, all germens spill at once that make a man irritable
I am happy to have this marriage for my peace.
She is fierce, though she is little.
He will not bear them as the ass bears gold, to groan and sweat under the business, either led or driven, as we point the way.

It may be.
She means, videlicet, my love.
Your fall has left a blot to mark the man who is a man who is a man of a great length and is best owed with some suspicion.
Your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his only heir and princess.
I will tell you just how I did not thrive in this fair ladyâ€™s love and she in mine.
She was the fairest creature in the world, and yet she is inferior to none.
He is at his time.
I am not in my perfect mind.
To run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself.
To see how he treats the foolish woman your wife!
If you sink in it, you will be tempted to fall in love.
To that end, we wish your Lordship here T's free from the slanders of the world.
To that end, sir, I will welcome you.
The Athenian law cannot pursue us.
Too soon they are made.
Trinculo is reeling ripe.
She is true, as she has proved herself.
Trust me, love, in my eye.
Turns the sun to shade.
Twenty of these lies I will tell men that I have been told I have discontinued school over a twelve month period.
And unrespective boys.
Wasnâ€™t you tempted, poor father, to hovel you with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw?
We thought it was our duty to let you know of it.
We mean well in going to this mask, but there is no wit to go.
We understand him well, how he comes to us with our wilder days, not measuring what we made of them.
We will hear it.
We will pay you a little more.
We will, like friends, go straight to each other.
We will send you there.
We will wear out in a walled prison pack and sects of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon.
Now, weep, seeing she is up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
It is more common than words.
Welcome, welcome!
If I were the king on a king, what would I do?
What are you saying that you will do so?
What is your idol ceremony?
What confederacy have you had with the traitors who have been late in the kingdom?
What do I give you back, who may be able to counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
What have kings that privates have not too, Save ceremony, Save general ceremony?

What is this noise?
What is that all of this?
What about him, Tranio?
What about him?
What other oath than honesty to honesty engaged, that this will be, or we will fall for it?

What is he saying when I play the villain?
What is her history?
What is the news, good cousin Lodovico?
What is going on from my despised time is naught but bitterness.
If you are going to be hapless tonight, give it a good understanding, but no tongue.
When is that going?
When he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the disputeâ€™s right, roused to the encounter, or ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.
When I do, I swear that Romeo will be the one who you know I hate, and not Paris.

Will you give me permission?
Will you rent our ancient love asunder to join men in discrediting your poor friend?
Will you be married under a bush like a beggar?
Were you going to have me?
Have you ever been cross-gartered?
With my hand, I seal my heartâ€™s love.
I will be squeezing her eyes with the juice of this juice and make her full of hateful fantasies.
Yesterday night, the bird of night sat on the marketplace, shrieking and sneezing.
You suddenly arose and sighed, with your arms across the table, and when I asked you what the matter was, you stared upon me with ungentle looks.
And yet you complain of obstruction?
I see that they are as sick as they are that they are that they are too sick to surf with too much as they are that they are not hungry with nothing.
I do not want to mind you, because you are framed by the truth of valor.
I wish I had something to do.
I would not be you, nuncle.
It is dangerous to make him even more o'clock than he has lost.
It is not so.
I will not want to see my sky.
He lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, and with a silken thread he swoops back again, so loving-jealous
And yet no matter what.
She will kneel and pray, I have seen her do it.
You will help me out of conflict.
She is still in the world.
I swear I am not that I play.
To say the truth, reason and love keep little company together.
And yon tall anchoring bark,
And yonder, Caesar.
You know, security is mortals' chief enemy.

You are well met, Signior Hortensio.
You are by land.
You are by land.
You have to cut this flesh from his breast.
You will be satisfied.
You will speak in the same pulpit as I am going, after my speech is finished.
You, gentle Hero?
You too, sir.

All the story of the night told over, and all their minds transfigured together, more witnesses than fancyâ€™s images and grows to something of great constancy, but, however, strange and admirable.
All this was my first knowledge.
Antonio is certainly gone.
Are my brotherâ€™s powers set forth?
Arenâ€™t we all sick?
Are they safe, Ariel?
Are you so in love as your rhymes speak?
Are you sure Benedick loves Beatrice so much?

Did you think the Prince would have served you in this way?
Did you see them dead?
Did you hear without asking how your name should be hanged and carved on these trees?
But you died of her love, my boy?

But for the bloody napkin?
I would have forgotten it by heaven.
But for the seventh cause.
For the stuffing, we are all mortal.
But for the whole world?

He is noble, wise, judicious, and knows the best of the season.
For your private satisfaction, because I love you, I will let you know.
For your words, they rob the Hybla bees and leave them honeyless.

He is armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
He has promised me that he will not hurt you, as he is a gentleman and a soldier.
He has chid me hence and threatened me to strike me, spur meâ€”nay, to kill me too.
He loves Caesar best
He protests that he loves you and needs no other suitor than his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you back in.

You will hear your voice, Gratiano.
But heavenly Rosalind!
Here is Antony.
Here is Antony.
My father comes here.
Here is the lady.
Here are the people who come here.
Here is a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him and charged him with a thousand marks in gold, and I denied my wife and house.
He is too weak to support the conflict.
He is a hollow man, like horses hot at hand, who is a savage man.

How has she received his love?
How is it that this lives in your mind?
How long will her sweet life last?
How long will that title last?

I prophesy the lights on Fortinbras.
I see you are moved.

I hope you have no intention of turning husband, have you?
I know nothing, and therefore I am no beast.

I might see Cupidâ€™s fiery shaft sunk in the chaste beams of the watery moon, and the imperial votaress passed on, in maiden meditation, fancy-free.
I must tell you that Claudio is facing my challenge, and either I will hear from him in a few minutes, or I will subscribe to him as a coward.

If he is at hand, I will be satisfied.
If he hadnâ€™t been drinking, he would have thrown you out of the way.
If I give my wife a handkerchief, what would I do?
If I had enough to get out of this wood, I would have enough to serve my own turn.
If it is a sin to honor honor, I am the most offending soul alive.
If it were, she would have to be careful not to comb your sleeve with a three-legged stool and paint your face and use you like a fool.
If she cannot love you, sir?
If I am, then I know that your weeping sister is no wife of mine, and I do not have to pay homage to her.

If we fail, we canâ€™t do it on land.
If you remember it, I did not want you to do it to the time.
If you refuse to marry me, you will give yourself to this faithful shepherd.
If you fail, without more speech, my lord, you must be gone from here immediately.
If you have a stomach, you will have me help you in all.
If you know this, my manners tell me that we have your wrong rebuke.
I do not care for you, sir.
In my terms of honor, I am aloof and will not reconcile with some elder masters until I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored.
I would not think that would happen.
If I do not do my job, I will be a child.
In this way, you have to be the one who is worthless.
I will be burying your daughter in the womb, where they will breed Selves of themselves, to your recomfort.
I was an old religious uncle of mine who taught me to speak, who was in his youth a inland man who knew too well of courtship, because there he fell in love.

Let it be.
Let it rest.
Let me hear the letter of your friend.
Let me go to my fortune and the skets.
Letâ€™s go.
Let them measure us by what they will.
Letâ€™s rearrange the more we think, the more we think we will, the more we think we will be able to spit out our lust-weary Antony.
Let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is only one shamed, never gracious, if killed, but one dead, willing to be killed.
My wife, and all the world are not with me, but above me.
Being weary of these worldly bars, life never lacks power to dismiss itself.
But little.

Not with such familiar situations as this, nor with such free and friendly conference as he used old.
I am not royal.
Not to mention me, signor.
I will be a little rushed.
Now you know, in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought, how London doesth eat her citizens.
I see our lances are only straws, our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, that seems to be the most which we are most.
I was the lord of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself.
Now I will tell you joyous tales, girl.
In the division of the kingdom, it appears that the dukes he values most, because equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of eitherâ€™s moiety.
Now my eyes, which I have hailed at you, hurt you.
Now the duke of Buckingham and I are from visiting his majesty.
They rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools.
Now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.
Now, I tell you that I am better than I was.
What do you say to me?
Now, my lord.
Tomorrow, when we will have state to Crave us together.
Oh, how bitter it is to look at happiness through another manâ€™s eyes.
How odd will it sound that I must ask my child forgiveness?

It is Mariaâ€™s hand.
Passion gives them power, time means, to meet, he is a sweet man.
You have a new story.
Tell me who.
Is he coming home?
My lord, it was not registered, but Methinks the truth should live from age to age, as it was retailed to all posterity, even to the general all-ending day.
Is it dinnertime?
I said o'er what I have said before.
Seven years since, in Syracusa, you know we have parted.
But will it be in the near future?
Will I live in hope?
We will wear these glories for a day, or will they last and we rejoice in them?
She is far more than Sycorax than her best friend.
She is none.
She is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
She keeps the lovÃ¨d boy from being crowned with flowers and makes him feel like she is all about her joy.
She, your subject, is not so sovereign.
Ships are only boards, sailors but men.
Since he is better, we have therefore odds.
Since he is obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envyâ€™s reach, I oppose my patience to his fury and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit.
Since it is as good as it is, you can do it for your own good.
Since the affairs of men are still uncertain, letâ€™s blame the worst that may be happening.

But speak, Egeus.
Stay for awhile.
Stop my ears and let me fall asleep.
But such officers do the best service in the end.
You can do it well and look at them all.
I am sure we will not win him.
I was so brave that he put me in a heartbreaking passion.
I smile at swords, weapons laugh to shame, and are brandished by a man born.
Take a taste of my finding him and enjoy it with good observance.

He who stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light, he dies upon his motion.
He that sweetest rose will find loveâ€™s prick, and Rosalind.
He will think to live till he is old, give me some help!
He sends you, meeter for your spirit, this treasure, and, instead of this, you want to let the dukedoms that you claim to have gotten away from you.
He thinks he is still at his instrument.
He thinks that twenty times of better fortune, he is twenty men to one.
He threw his eye aside and marked what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity, a wretched,
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under that he shoots his wit.
He was a bachelor.
He was a king.
He was a man.
He was a fool who brought me back to me.
He was a little ill, but suddenly a Roman thought struck him.
He was furnished like a hunter.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.
He was born to shame.
He was not merry, which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in Egypt with his joy, but between both.
He was not sad, because he would shine on those who make their looks look like he did.
He was not three leagues off when I left him.
He was quick to get a little irritated when he went to school.
He was the wretched man when he was young, so long a-growing and so leisurely, that if this rule were true, he would be gracious.

He wonders how long you have assembled troops of citizens to come to him, not being warned of it before.
He wore his beaver up.
He would be crowned.
He would have deserved it.
He would make it a sport and torment the poor lady.

He would not take the crown.
He would not?
He loves the prince, for his fatherâ€™s sake, so much that he will not be won to slap him.
He, he, is he.
He was the best lady to be fair.
He, sir, must marry this woman.
He, sir.
He, that Caliban who is now in service.
He is now in durance at Malvolioâ€™s suit, a gentleman and follower of my ladyâ€™s suit.
He canâ€™t refrain from the excess of laughter when he hears of her.
He, woman.
He.
He will be hanged yet, though every drop of water swears against it and gapes at widest to get him to sleep.
He will only break a comparison or two on me, which, if he is not marked or laughed at, strikes him into melancholy, and then there is a wing saved, for the fool will eat

He is not worth more.
Hear a little further and then I will bring you to the business which is now on, without the story that was most impertinent.
Hear Antony.
Hear his speech but say you have a good chance.
Hear it apart.
Hear it not, Duncan, because it is a knell that summons you to heaven or hell.

Hear me, my lord.
Hear me, Queen: The need for time commands our services for awhile, but my heart is still in use with you.
Hear me, recreant!
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out of sharing what you have pilled from me!
Hear my excuse.
Hear my soul speak.

Hear you, sir?
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
If you are a heart, you will be stronger than your continent.
Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot think, speak, cast, write, sing, numberâ€”hoo!
You are so hearty.
Heaven and earth!
Heaven and your thoughts are witnessing that you are.
Heaven and you had part in this fair maid.
Heaven knows it.
Keep the monster from Othelloâ€™s mind.
Heaven knows what she has known.
Heaven makes you free of it.
I send such uses, not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
Heaven will keep you alive!
Heaven will rest them now.
Heaven knows that you are false as hell.
Heaven would have given her these gifts and I would live and die her slave.
Heavenly powers, restore him!
Heavens keep him from these beasts.
Heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him.
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a sham.
Heavens thank you for not!
Heavens, I am the best of them who speak this speech, if I were speaking in the same way.
Heigh-ho.
Helen, it is not so.
Helen, to you, we will unfold.
Helena, adieu.
Help me, ho!
Help me in some house, Benvolio, or I will faint.
Help me, help me!
Help me, my women!

Help me dress up, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
Help, angels.
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, help, help!
Help, help, help!
Help, ho, help!
Help, ho!
Help!
He will be away.
The world is awash with banishÃ¨d, and the world is exiled with death.
He is growing ambitious, and you hear it?
I will then go to my ghostly friarâ€™s cell, his help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
So, with your little ones.
So, be my grave my peace, as I give her her fatherâ€™s heart from her.
So, and stand aloof.
So, away!
Be gone, away!
So, get you gone and follow me no more.
That is a horrible shadow!
You are a horrible villain, or I will scare you like balls before me.
So, let's not let his fortune take over you.
Make sure you are doing your best.
Mardian, bring me how he takes my death.
You are a farmer!
So, eunuch!
So!
So!
So!
So!
So.
So.
I will never be Romeo.
I will continue to cry out of it, â€œEnough, enoughâ€ and die.

Hey, Mountain, hey!
Hidâ€™s that forehead with a golden crown? Where should be branded, if that right was right, the slaughter of the prince who owed that crown and the terrible death of my poor sons and brothers?

The queen of state, Great Juno, comes.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.
He and his worth and our great need of him have been well conceived.
He is there in person?
He is the man.
His absence blames his promise.
His affections do not tend to be so.
He said that the people were not used to be spoken to, but by the recorder.
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot is very expert and approved.
He was grizzled, no?
He does not breathe on the earth.
His breeding, sir, is at my charge.
His captainâ€™s heart, which has burst in the scuffles of great fights, reneges all temper and is becoming the bellows and the fan to cool a gypsyâ€™s

His company must do his magic, while I at home hunger for a merry look.
He is a good counsel.
He does not like me.
His lips were fliessing from their color, and that same eye whose bend awes the world lost his luster.
He will be king and queen, and we will be viceroys.
His daughter will be brought to the supper by you.
His daughters seek his death.
He is dead, but not dead.
He can, I am sure, be a fool, because the goose does not carry the fox.

His grace made the match, and all of his grace said â€œAmenâ€ to it.
He looks cheerful and smooth this morning.

His highness is not good.
His honor and myself are at the one, and at the other is my good friend Catesby, where nothing can proceed that touches us, where I will not have intelligence.
His horse is killed, and he fights all on foot, seeking Richmond in the throat of death.
His hour is almost past.
His indignation comes from a very competent injury.

He will be speaking if you have tuned.
He is so strong that he is not so strong.
His letter here will show you his estate.

His majesty, Tend'ring my personâ€™s safety, has appointed this conduct to convey me to the Tower.
He is Balthazar.
My lord, Tyrrel.
He is his name!
His name is Cinna.

His nurse?

His passport will be made, and crowns for convoy will be put in his purse.
He is here and your pains we thank you for.
His arm shook the world.
I know his reason.
His roguish madness allows itself to anything.
He is a royal man, who is better than you would wish, and who is better than you would wish.
His soldiership is twice the other two.
He is older, sir.
His son is thirty.
He was a ward just two years ago.
His speech was like a tangled chain.
He hears me and I must curse.
His taints and honors are equal to him.
He has taken the infection of the device, man.
He is very right.
His wits are gone.
His word is more than the miraculous harp.
His word could bear my wealth at any time.
He said, â€œFarewell, mistress.â€ Nothing else.
Ho, ho, ho!
Let the door be locked.
Now you strike like the blind man.
Open the door.
Hob, nob, is his word.
Hold him in safety until the Prince comes to him.
Hold little faith, though you have too much fear.

Holla!
Holy Franciscan Friar!
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here.
Home, you idle creatures get you home!
Honest Iago Hath taâ€™en order for â€™t.
Honest Nurse, farewell.
Honest, ay, honest.
Honest, my lord?
Honest, my lord?
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hood my unmanned blood batting in my cheeks, until you get a strange love, grow bold, think true love acted simple modesty.
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.
Hope I will choose, sir.
Hoppedance cries in Tomâ€™s belly for two white herrings.

Horrible steep.
Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs.

I would not be sworn for him if he didnâ€™t leave it, nor do he steal it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters.
I do not want to be damned.
I will draw as soon as another man sees occasion in a good dispute and the law on my side.
I do not want to lay any money on the table.
I do not want to answer his question.
I do not want to confess that I would not be able to compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well, I would have to know himself.
I do not drink yet, madam.
I do not want to be taken.
I do not want to, sir.
I do not want him to be able to do so to feel my affection for you and to no other pretense of danger.
I am going to say you love him, and you love him, so you can tell him how you speak it to others.
I swear he is no hypocrite, but he prays from his heart.
I swear that this is the right Vincentio.
I do not want to kill you for a villain.
I am not a lecher.
I am a fan of masques and sometimes revels in them.
I denied you that.
I do not say it.
I do not want to be more pleased than to be under sail tonight.
I want you to be more familiar, good Master Mustardseed.
I did enact Julius Caesar.
I heard him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books â€” â€œAlas,â€ it cried, â€œgive me some drink, Tit
I heard the horse screaming.
I did her wrong, canst she tell how an oyster makes his shell?
I love you once.
I never knew a voice issue from a heart so empty.
I did not give the lie.
I did not kill your husband.
I have not seen him since.
I did not see you since you sent me home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
I did not think he had been familiar with her.
I did not think to draw my sword against Pompey, because he laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me.
I did not think you could have been so angry.
I did not think I had met you here.
I did not lock you up, husband, gentlemen.
I did not.
I did nothing.
When I first raised the tempest, I said so.
I sent you gold for my legions, which you denied me.
I sent you a ring in chase after the last enchantment you had here.
I did so and take heed on it, make it a darling like your precious eye.
I did so, and went further, which is now our point of second meeting.
I think it was formed by the excellent constitution of your leg.
I did not know him.
I did, my lord.
I did, my lord.
I did.
I am not going to arrest you, sir.
I assure you, father, that it is.
I assure you that it is not against my will.
I do not think it is a complete addition, nor my wish, to have him see me womaned.
I begin to have bloody thoughts.
I think he was.
I believe it, and I ask you to be apologied.
I believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
If you bear me hard, you will be able to do so.
I beg you that are of a suppler joint, follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them.
I am very happy to help you understand my purpose.
I ask you to do so, and I will ask you to do so.
I am sure you have patience.
I do not want you to worry anymore.
I do not want to be a fool, I will not.
I am very happy with you.
I beg you to pardon me, who, in the service of my God, awaited my visitation of my friends.
I beg you to be a god to pardon me, and I will be able to be a god to be a god.
I am so thankful for your Grace, let me know my fault.
If you are a woman, I will call her back.
I bite my thumb, sir.
I am a little adolescent, to be my henchman.
I do, but keep the peace.
I do, but stay until your marriage is over, and then go to Aragon.
I confess my fault and submit me to Your Highness' mercy.
I agree with him.
I do not defy your commination and apprehend you for a felon here.
I do not want it with my heart, and I hope it is not a dishonest desire to be a woman of the world.
I do not want to do more.
I do not want to be better strangers.
I accept your offer and dispose for the poor Claudio.
I am not a man, except I alone, until Antony has spoken.
I am a man of grace.
I fear the people will choose Caesar for their king.
I hear the morning lark.
I know what I am doing and fear that mine eye is too flattering for me.
I know him by his name.
I know when the blood burns, how prodigal the soul is when the tongue vows.
I do not have a part of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
I love it better than laughing.
I love nothing in the world so well as you.
I do not use it.
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, nor tell tales of you to judge Jove.
I do not want to call you.
I do not want to ask him for me, and yet I decide to fight lustrously for him.
I do not find that you deal justly with me.
I do not know dat.
I do not know one of my sex, no womanâ€™s face remembersâ€”except mine.
I do not know what is â€œpoeticalâ€.
I do not know you as well as myself.
I do not know what I should think.
I do not know.
I do not like her name.
I do not like the office.
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
I do not like your look, I promise you.
I do not like your faults.
I do not fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason I think, that my lady loves me.
I do not see them bleed.
I do not set my life in a pinâ€™s fee for my soulâ€”what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?
I do not think it.
I do not think it is good.
I do not think so.
I do not think there is any woman like this.
I do not think you can, because you were not three years old.
I do not understand.
I do not know, my lord.
I do not understand that.
I do not, sir.
I do not, until you practice them on me.
I let go of my opinion, and hold it down. This is not a fish, but a islander who has suffered lately from a thunderbolt.
I obey you till I give you bail.
I remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughterâ€™s favor.
I remember me, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond should be king when Richmond was a little peeveish boy.
I remember it now.
I remember where I should be, and I am here.
I remember.
I apologize for the way I put it to you.
I do not regret the tedious minutes I have spent with her.
I will require them from you, so that you can use them as we will find their merits and our safety may be equally determined.
I do serve you in this business.
I do so, I confess.
I suffer love, because I love you against my will.
I suspect I have done some offense that seems disgraceful in the cityâ€™s eyes, and that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
I do the wrong thing, and begin to scream.
I think there is a stifle in death, which commits some loving act upon her.
I wander everywhere Swifter than the moonâ€™s sphere.
I do, this is a shameful thing.
I do, and it is a sleepy language, and you speak out from your sleep.
I do, Mark Antony.
I swear you are honest.
I do.
I do.
I doubt it is only the main thing: his fatherâ€™s death and our o'erhasty marriage.
I doubt it, sir, but you will curse your wooing.
I doubt not, but his friends will come to us.
I doubt not about his temperance.
I doubt not your wisdom.
I doubt that, since we are well-persuaded, we do not carry a heart with us from which we do not have a heart that grows in a fair consent with ours, and we do not leave one behind
I doubt some danger is approaching you.
I doubt some foul play.
I dreamed of a dream tonight.
I dreamed of the three weird sisters last night: they have shown some truth to you.
I dreamed of a emperor Antony.
I dreamed tonight that I feasted with Caesar, and things are causing my fantasy.
I had to do some of them.
I drink to you.
I am drunk!
I have denied that before you were so choleric.
I do not want to do it.
I am begging my lord to say she is honest, and I will lay down my soul at stake.
I eat the air, promise-crammed.
I embrace it.
I fear choleric.
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, he is so sad in his youth.
I fear he will.
I fear I will wrong the men who have stabbed Caesar.
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
I fear it, I promise you.
I fear both are false.
I fear you will be here until then.
I fear my Thisbeâ€™s promise is forgotten!
I fear no uncles are dead.
I fear you will not.
I fear you will again come for a ransom.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other menâ€™s.
I have no idea what you are doing.
I feared he would do it, but he would do it.
I feel this pinprick.
I fight against you?
I find that Don Pedro has given a lot of honor to a young Florentine called Claudio.
I find it still when I have left to sleep.
I am not a sleeper.
I find you passing gentle.
I fly, Biondello.
I follow him to serve my turn on him.
I forget, but these sweet thoughts make me feel the most busy when I do it.
I forgive you for the praise.
I found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.
I found him under a tree like a sprained acorn.
I found it in my room, and he confessed to it, but now he dropped it for a special purpose which he wanted to do.
I found it in my closet.
I found Cassioâ€™s kisses on her lips.
I found them on a tree.
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesarâ€™s trencher.
I am a smuggler and snort and I am a rich jewel.
I fown upon him, but he loves me still.
I gave him no order.
I gave him the stuff.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear never to do so.
I gave you mine before you asked for it, and yet I would give it again.
I gave you allâ€” and in good time you gave it.
I give myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
I give him curses, but he gives me love.
I give it to you.
I give them this ring, which you can give away when you lose or lose it, and let it presage the ruin of your love.
I go to take my stand to see him pass on to the Capitol.
I go, I go.
I go, my lord.
I go, my lord.
I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire to have is the sin of covetousness.
I go to three or four o'clock and look for the news that the Guildhall offers.
I go.
I go.
I go.
I go.
I give him bloody, vile, false, deceitful, smacking of every sin that has a name.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
I am a woman, but I am a woman well-reputed Catoâ€™s daughter.
I grant it has not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.
If you frightened the ladies out of their wits, they would have no choice but to hang us.
I grant you.
I will greet you with no regret, but with a baffling acceptance.
I guess that is true.
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the slapped motion that is so mortal that it is inevitable.
I had a Richard, and you killed him
I had a son, now outlawed from my blood.
I had a wound that was like a â€œTâ€ but now it is made an â€œHâ€. They retire.

I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, so I had nothing known.
I was perfect, whole as the marble, founded as the rock, as broad and general as the air.
I had forgotten the reward.

I had it of him.
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.
I had the most need of blessing, and â€œAmenâ€ suck in my throat.
I had my fatherâ€™s signet in my purse, which was the model of that Danish seal.
I had myself notice of my brotherâ€™s purpose herein and have underhand a lot of work done to dissuade him from it.
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it is better for me to be disdained than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any other.
I had rather be a country servant-maid than a great queen with this condition, to be so baited, scorned and stormed.
I had rather be a dog and a moon than a Roman.
I had rather been a peddler.
I had rather be a toad and live on the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing I love for others' uses.
I had rather be a fool than a fool.
I had rather be married to a deathâ€™s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these.
I had rather broken my own.
I had a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad.
I had a handful or two of dried peas.
I had rather had my horse to my mistress.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should be a crime to Michael Cassio.
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
I had rather than forty pounds at home.
I had rather to adopt a child than get it. Come on, Moor.
I thought it had been poor, but since my lord is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
I hate a drunken rogue.
I hate ingratitude more in a man than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, or any taint of vice whose strong corruption infects our frail blood â€” O heaven
I hate it as a void.
I hate the Moor, and it is thought abroad that he has done my office.
I hate the word, as I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
I havenâ€™t seen it in my nose.
I havenâ€™t.

I am interested in your heart's proceeding.
I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is closer to his reverence.
I have as much of this in art as you, but my nature could not bear it.
I have been dear to him, a little more than two thousand strong.
I have been talking with a suitor here, a man who slams you.
I have been to seek you.

I have done it.
I have done it.
I have drunk only one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too.
I have drunk poison while he said it.
I have never held my cap to your fortunes.
I have fair meanings, sir.
I have fled myself and instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders.
I forgot why I called you back.
I forgot your name, but I was sure that the part was properly fitted and naturally performed.
I have been sworn in with his bed and his company.
I have a whole cause of weeping, but this heart will break into a hundred thousand flaws, or ere I will weep.
I am very pleased with this fellow.
I have had four disputes, and like to have fought one.
I have heard her swear 'no'.
I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he has taxed their whole sex withal.
I have heard it over, and it is nothing, nothing in the world, unless you can find sport in their intents, extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain to do you service.
I have heard it said so.
I have heard more since.
I have heard my father name him.
I have heard of some men who put conflicting thoughts on others, to taste their valor.
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough.
I have heard that Julius Caesar eats fat with feasting there.
I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.
I have heard where many of the best respect in Rome, except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus and groaning under this ageâ€™s yoke, have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes
I have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify for his rigorous course.
I have a lot of slews in me.
I have it here about me.
I have it not about me.
I have it ready for you.
I have it, and it is soundly.
I have it, Tranio!
I have known when he would have walked ten miles afoot to see a good armor, and now he will lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet.
I have known when he had no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now he would rather hear the tabor and the pipe.
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
I have led you oft
I have slapped her, but she is doing it, and Jove is making me thankful.
I have lived long enough.
I have locked the letter in my closet.
I have been looking at the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish between a benefit and a injury, I never found a man who knew how to love himself.
I have made it for you.
I have made no fault.
I have made a strong proof of my constantity, giving myself a wound here in the thigh.
I have many enemies in Orsinoâ€™s court, and I would be very soon to see you there.
I have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face, a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat those blushes away, and in her eye there has been a fire to burn the errors that

I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am a bit irritated.
I have some business.
I have spoken so much to mitigate the justice of your plea, which, if you follow, this strict court of Venice must give a sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
God knows, I have been in pain and in agony for you.
I have them ready.
I have been informed of them this evening from my sister, and with such cautions that if they come to my house I will not be there.
I told him that Lepidus was too cruel, that he was abused and deserve his change.

I have too much to grieve for a long leave.
I have two nights watched with you, but I can not see any truth in your report.
I have re-anned three tailors.
I have used it since you made your daughters a mother.

I have a good opinion, sir.
I have a thousand tricks of these jacks that I will practice.
I have forty-huit years on my back.
I have yet to have room for six scotches more.
I am, my lord.
I have, since I was three, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
I am, when you have heard what I can say.
I have.
I hear a knock knocking at the south entrance.
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, cry â€œCaesar!â€â€”Speak.
I hear him mock the luck of Caesar, which the gods give men to excuse their wrath.
I hear him.
I hear his trumpet.
I hear it by the way, but I will send it.
I hear it now above me.
I hear my father coming.
I am not.
I hear some noise inside.
I hear some noise.

I hear the news, my lord.
I hear the strain of strutting chanticleer Cry â€œCock-a-diddle-dow.â€ Where should this music be?

I heard him swear his affection.
I did not hear it.
I heard myself proclaiming, and by the happy hollow of a tree, I escaped the hunt.
I have nothing heard.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
I heard you say that even now, you are not saying that when Cassio left my wife.

I give you that with all my heart, but you have already done, with all my heart I would keep from you.
I take my oath before this honorable assembly, she kicked the poor king her father.

I knew you at the first time.
I knew your father.
I know it, my sisterâ€™s sister.

I know he loves me well.
I know he would not be a wolf, but he sees the Romans as sheep.

I know her by her name.
I know her father, though I know her not, and he knew my deceasÃ¨d father well.
I know him.
I know him as a valiant.
I know him well.
I know him

I know who is in the case, but he is in a suit of buff who rested him.
I know not by what power I am made bold nor how it may affect my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts, but I beg you to know that I will know the worst that may be possible in this
I know not how to pray for your patience, but I must speak.
I know if it is true, but I will do so as if I was for sure.
I know that, when he knows what I know.
I know what was not, but I am distracted.
I donâ€™t know what to say.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down.
I know he is not where he is, and for me to devise a lodging and say he is here, or he is there, I would lie in my own throat.
I know which is which.
I donâ€™t know why he comes.
I do not know what you want, gentlemen, who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
I know it, lady.
I know it, madam.

I know the boy will be able to give a gentlewoman the grace, voice, and a gentlewoman.
I know the glove is a glove.
I know the good king and queen have sent you for you.
I know the hand.
I know the man.
I know you not.
I know you well enough.
I know you well, a villain who is so ill-equipped to the vices of your mistress as badness would desire.
I know you well.
I know you well.
I know you, Roderigo.
I know they are in Rome together looking for Antony.
I know that is a joy to you, but it is not.

Here is the trout that must be caught with tickling.
You are there.
Let her lie with her.
Do you have a good time with her?
Do you have a relationship with her?
I am here to help.
Life and these lips have been separated for years.
Life, living, all is Deathâ€™s.
Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn.
Light, gentlemen, I will bind it with my shirt.
Light, I say, light!
Light!
Lights, lights, lights!
Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman.
Like aqua vitae with a midwife.
Like her?
Like one of two competing in a prize that thinks he has done well in peopleâ€™s eyes, hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of

I was not afraid of them when they said, â€œGod bless us!â€
Listen, but not to a tad.
â€œNo, Isnâ€™t it?
Live a little, comfort a little, cheer yourself a little.
If I live a thousand years, I will not find myself so apt to die.
Live you, I live.
Live, and hereafter say A madmanâ€™s mercy bid you to run away.
Live, Brutus!
Live, live!
He lives, good uncle?
He lives?
Does my sweet son live?
Lives, sir.
You are right!
Lo you, here she comes.
I lie, never to rise again.
Here on your cheek, the stifle is a tear that is not slammed yet.
Hereâ€™s the chain.
Now, lo!
Lo, she is one of this confederacy.
Lo, where he comes from!
Lo, where it comes again.
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourn it.
Locked in her monument.
Long live the king!
Long love does so.
Since your husband served me in my wars, I have been to you with a princeâ€™s word, when you made him master of your bed, to do him all the grace and good I could.
He was so long gone.
Longer, longer.
Look behind you, my lord.
Look down, you gods, and on this couple drop a blessÃ¨d crown, because you are the ones who have wrought the way that brought us here.

Look at how your servants do to you, each in his office ready at your beck.
Isnâ€™t I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
Look in my face.
Look in the almanac.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
Look in on me and speak with me, or, naked as I am, I will assault you.
Look like a innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.
Look for a good edified fool when he delivers the madman.
You are sweet, and I am proof of their enmity.
If you do not, I will charge you.
Look to it.
Look to her, Moor, if you have eyes to see.
Look at my chattels and my movables.
Look at the lady.
Look to the queen there, ho!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Look up a-height.
Look at Caesar.
Look what I have.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, you are still crossing it.
What is done now cannot be changed.
Look at him, he has not turned his color and tears in his eyes.
Look where he comes from.
Look where it comes again!
Look where she comes from.
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes from.
Look where they come from.
Look at who comes here.
Look with thin ears.
Look for any other issue?
Look at you here, here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.
Look at you who comes here, a young man and a young man in solemn talk.
Look you, Cassio, and my husband!
If you take the matter out of the way, Captain Macmorris, I will think you do not use me with that affability, as long as you have discretion, and you should use me.
You, sad friends, The gods rebuke me, but it is a tiding to wash the eyes of kings.
Look you, she loved Tybalt, and I loved it.
Look you, sir, I was there.
Look at you, the worm is not to be trusted, but to be kept in the best interests of wise people, because there is no goodness in the worm.
Look, and you will see.

Look, where he comes from.
Look, where she comes from.
Look, where your love comes from.
Look, with a spot I damn him.
Look at what kind of action it takes to get you to a more removed ground.
Look!
Have you ever looked like he was red or pale, sad or merrily?
Does he look as fresh as he did the day he wrestled?
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost absolute Alexas, where is the soothsayer that you praised so to your Queen?
Lord Edmund said not to your lord at home?
Lord Hamlet, Heaven will protect him.
Lord Mayor, the reason we sent you is to look back!
Lord of his fortunes, he salutes you and demands to live in Egypt, which he refuses to grant, and to you he will sue to let him breathe between the heavens and earth.

Lorenzo certain, and my love indeedâ€”Who love me so much?
Lorenzo, and your love.
Lorenzo, I commit to your work and manage my house until my lord returns.
Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities.
Love gives me strength, and strength will help me.
Love is a madness and, tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do. The reason why they are not punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whip
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.
Love me or hate me, I like the cap, and it will be my job, or I will not have any.
Love news, in faith?
Love wrought these miracles.
Love, and be friends as two men should be.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity, in my capacity.
Love?
Loveâ€™s earbuds should be thoughts, which are ten times faster than the sunâ€™s beams, driving back shadows over louring hills.
Love is not love when it is mingled with regards to the whole point.
If love is blind, it is best to agree with night.
Lovers, make moan.
Lovers, to bed.
Lucentio is your name.
Lucentio, sir.
Lucentio!
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders to lodge their companies tonight.

Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all of our terrible ills follow us to our graves.

Malcolm!
Malvolio is coming down this walk.
I have a lot of people sold his life, but I am outside.

It would be as a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.
You will not.
Yes, that is certain.
Yes, that is certain.
Yes, that is certain.
Yes, that is certain.
Yes, that is not the case.
Nay, that is not your way.
Yes, that is true.
The dust would have ascended to heaven, surrounded by your troops.
Nay, the man who has no wits that cannot, from the rise of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, deserve praise on my palfrey.
Nay, their work keeps in the wonted pace.
If I have a ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.
Nay, then she can only hate you, a woman who bought love with such a bloody spoil.
You are not alone, and all my pains are sorted to no proof.
Nay, then you lie.
Well, well, th' event.
Good night, then.
Nay, then, you mock me.
So, then, letâ€™s go hand in hand, not one before another.
Nay.
Nay, this was his dream.
Nay, very pale.
We must think men are not gods, and neither of them will look for such observances as fit the bridal.
Nay, we will all be there to fetch him.
Nay, we will slink away in the evening, disguise us at my lodging, and return in an hour.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros.
When I wear a suit, I will be able to touch your love with you.
There is more to this.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.
You must forget that.
You have to name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lionâ€™s neck.
You have to be afraid of us, Lorenzo.
You were a fragment of Gneius Pompeyâ€™s, and you have picked out what you have picked up.
You were better off speaking first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
I will be a knave of them all who will be a knave of them all.
I can't look at day, nor sleep on night, but she tells you to tell you a simple truth.
Near and on a fast foot.
He is the closest to his heart.
Need and oppression hunger in your eyes.
Need you my help?
When I was poisoned, I had to be able to get to know mine.
You know there are no junkets at the feast.
Neighbors, God speed.
Both are alive.
Is neither good nor bad.
Isnâ€™t my husband or the slave returning to the slaveâ€™s house in such a hurry?
We cannot tell you how much rhyme or reason can tell you.
I am not to you, nor to anyone, having no witness to confirm my speech.
I am not the only one.
I have neither.
Nerissa taught me what to believe.
Never alone did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Never anger made good guard for itself.
Never at quiet.
Never believe it.
Never came poison from a place so sweet.
Never come such division tweeted our souls.
Never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of the most dangerous treason than I did at this hour joy o'er myself, Prevented from a damned enterprise.
Never did I know a creature that bears the shape of a man so keen and greedy to confound a man.
Never excuseâ€”when the players are all dead, there is no reason to blame.
Never fear that.
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.
Never king of England had nobles richer and loyaler subjects, who have left their bodies here in England and lie in the fields of France.
Never make denial.
Never tell anyone what you have seen tonight.
Never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold.
Never talk to me.
I never saw him touch with anger so distempered.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Never trust me.
Never was monarch better feared and loved than your Majesty.
Never was seen so black a day as this.
I never resisted him until I was armed.
Never, Iago.
Never, my lord.
Never, my lord.
Never, until Caesarâ€™s three and thirty wounds are healed, or until another Caesar has added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Never.
News from Verona!
I have heard that my Nell is dead i' th' spital of a malady of France, and there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
News, friends!
News, lads, Our wars are done!
News, madam.
News from Rome, my good lord.
News, old news, and news you never heard of.
Next month with us.
Next, Cleopatra confesses to your greatness, submits her to your power, and you craves the circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, now hazarded
Niece, will you look at those things I told you about?
Niggard of question, but of our demands.
Night hangs on mine eyes.
Nightâ€™s candles are burnt out and day stands on the sands of the mountain tops.
Nine or ten times I had thought he had been snuck here under the ribs.
Ninus' tomb, man.
No â€œmasterâ€, sir, but a poor manâ€™s son.
No beast so fierce, but he knows some of the pity.
No better.
No ambition does our arms incite us to love, but love is right.
No jokes like a fool.
No cause, no cause.
No child except Hero
No cock of mine.
No shame, you will be able to refuse him at sea, and be prepared for land.
He has a quiet catch.
The murd'rous knife was dull and blunt until it was sprayed on your stone-hard heart, to revel in the entrails of my lambs.
I will bet you are doing your best.
No doubt, my lord.
No doubt.
No epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse.
Nothing is lost when it is gone.
No eyes in your head, no money in your purse?
No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess, to gratulate the gentle princes there.
No further, sir.
No further, sir.
No going then!
No grave on earth shall clip in it a pair of men so famous.
No more heart in you?
No harm.
No hope that way is another way so high that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, but doubt discovery there.
No jewel is like Rosalind.
No jutty, frieze, buttress, nor vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
No king of England, if not king of France.
If you are, Malvolio, then you should know.
What follows?
No man born of woman will have power upon you.
No man was to be trusted with them.
No one wants to marry his subjects?
He was ill affected.
She is not a marvel, but she can be a sailor who has no other reason.
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.
No masque tonight.
No matter how bad you are, you are not here.
No matter what, since they have left their snuffs behind, we have stomachs.
No matter what.
No medicine in the world can do you good.
No messenger but thine, and all alone tonight we will wander through the streets and see the qualities of people.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.
No more a soldier.
No more amazement.
No more being done.
No more than a woman, and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares.
No more, but so?
No more light answers.
No more drowning, do you hear?
No more of that.
No more of that.
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
I do not mourn for yours.
I will be here in Egypt.
No more that a tad of Cawdor will deceive our bosom interest: go pronounce his death, and greet Macbeth with his former title.
No more with me.
No more words.
No more, cousin.
No more, I pray you.
No more, I pray you.
No more, no more.
No more!
No more.
No more.
No more.
No more.
No news of them?
No noise, and enter.
No occupation.
No offense i' m world.
No pains, sir.
No passage?
No place will please me, no mean of death, as here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age.
No port is free, no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my take.
No seconds?
No shame, but mine.
No slander.
He would be king on it.
No jade as you, if you mean.
No, I see thisbe.
No warmth, no breath will testify you live.
No watch?
No way to do it, but gentleness, gentleness.
No womanâ€™s heart so big, to hold so much.
No wonder, my lord.
No wonder, sir, but certainly a little girl.
No words can that woe sound.
No words.
No, it is hereafter to know, but now to promise.
Yes, it is not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but it is too deep, it will not serve.
No, it was the vane on the house.
No, I found it, and I gave it to my husband.
No, and swears she never will.
Nehmen Sie das Lot, Antony.
No, as I am a Christian.
No, as I will be saved.
No, believe me.
No, boy.
No, but she let it drop by negligence and, to my advantage, I didnâ€™t take up.
No, but the barberâ€™s man has been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek has already stuffed tennis balls.
No, but to the gate, and there will be a devil who will meet me like a cuckold with horns on his head and say, â€œGet you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven
No, by mine honor, madam.
No, by my life and soul.
No, no.
No, no.
No, by this hand.
No, by this heavenly light!
No, Caesar has not.
No, Caesar will not.
No, Caesar, we will answer their charge.
No, Cassio is not killed.
No, Cassius, no.
Corin, being old, you can't guess, although in your youth you were as true a lover as ever as sighed upon a midnight pillow.
No, cousin, I will go to Fife.
No, coz, I prefer to sigh.
No, dear Queen, we intend to dispose you as you will give us counsel.
No, fair princess.
No, faith, die by attorney.
No, faith, hate him, for my sake.
No, faith, I will not stay a jot longer.
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.
No, faith, my coz, I do not wish a man from England.
No, faith, not a jot.
No, because I believe he is not worthy of his place that does those things.
No, forgive me.
No, good mother.
No, great king.
Yes, hasnâ€™t it?
No, he does not, but he does not.
No, he is the best man in Athen.
He is a yeoman who has a gentleman to his son, because he is a mad yeoman who sees his son a gentleman before him.
No, he is in a terrible situation, worse than hell.
No, heavens forbid me from killing your soul.
No, his mouth is stopped.
Yes, I am a Welshman.
No, I am promised.
No, I do not know you, nor am I sent to you by my lady, to ask you to speak with her, nor do you name me as Master Cesario, nor this is my nose.
No, I pray you speak in a sigh of judgment.
No, I protest, I do not know the contents.
Yes, I warrant you.
No, I warrant your Grace that you will not be able to get him to a second, who has so mightily convinced him to a second.
I went to work, and my young mistress said so.
No, I will be the pattern of all patience.
No, I will go to some ditch where I will die.
No, I will not cast my physicist away from those who are sick.
Yes, I will not.
No, I will not be able to do more.
No, I will not weep.
If you are not able to do so, you will get it.
Yes, they are not.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly.
No, it starts again.
No, it is Casca, one that is a part of our attempts.
It is not possible to love the enemy of France, Kate.
No, it is struck.
No, it is yours, my selfâ€™s better part, my dear heartâ€™s dearer heart, my food, my fortune, and my sweet hopeâ€™s aim, my sole earthâ€™s heaven, and my heavenâ€™s
No, Kate?
No, lad.
No, lady.
No, Lepidus, let him speak.
No, let me know, and knowing what I am, I know what she will be.
Yes, let me do it.
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning.
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.
No, madam, I do not read madness.
No, madam, no.
No, madam.
No, madam.
No, make it two more.
No, Messala.
No, monster, not I.
No, dearest love, I would not be able to do anything for the world.
No, my fair cousin.
No, my knight.
No, my good lord.
No, my good lord.
No, my good lord.
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
No, my lord, not I. Alas, it is the baseness of your fear that makes you slap on your own.
No, my lord, unless I have another for working days.
No, my lord.
No, my lord.
No, my most wronged sister.
No, my noble lord.
No, my heart.
No, no, by Godâ€™s grace, his son will reign.
No, no, forsooth, I do not want to live.
No, no, he is gone.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, because beasts that meet me run away from me.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, the bell.
No, no, they would not.
No, no, we will hold it as a dream until it appears itself.
No, no.
No, no.
No, none by me.
No, no one you have enough to make.
I am not, nor do I neither, but it is very wonderful that she does not do anything to protect Signor Benedick, whom she has abused in all her behavior.
No, nor mine now.
No, nor more fearful.
No, not a denier.
No, not a grize.
No, not a whit.
No, not an oath.
No, not for all the world.
No, not Venice.
He is not, though his face is better than any manâ€™s, yet his leg excels all menâ€™s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they are not to be talked about, yet
No, not much moved.
No, not so, villain, you are the villain.
No, not until a hot January.
No, not until Thursday.
No, not tonight.
Nein, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
No, pray you, good Meg, I will wear this.
No, pray for you, let it serve for table talk.
No, pray you.
I will go to Benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion.
Since.
No, sir, it is in grain
No, sir, God forbids, but ashamed to kiss.
No, sir, I live in the church.
No, sir, I say his horse comes with him on his back.
No, sir, it is legs and thighs.
No, sir, no jot.
No, sir, the worse.
No, sir.
Yes, some of it is for my childâ€™s father.
No, sooth, sir.
No, let him be judge how deep I am in love.
No, you will not wait until you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her.
No, you dream, that play is so subtly a kingâ€™s repose.
No, though you call your name a hotter name than anyone is in hell.
No, your words are too precious to be cast away on curs.
No, to my cabin.
No, to their lives, ill friends were contrary.
No, to Whitefriars.
Yes, I have been there for 12 months.
No, truly, but in a friendly recompense.
No, truly, because the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
If you are hard-favored, you can do it with honesty and beauty.
Yes, truly.
Yes, truly.
No, trust me, sir, nor I. I am sure you do.
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way have made it tedious, sluggish and heavy.
No, uncle, I will never be.
Nein, ne me appoint me.
No, we will be arguing with him.
No, wench!
You will paint when you are old.
No, you will be fined.
No, you are a savage man.
No!
No?
No?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Noble Antony, not sickness should be a threat to me.
Noble captain, come.
Who is the noblest of men, donâ€™t you?
Nobody comes here?
Nobody marks you.
Nobody.
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
Nothing at all.
He is not a holy hermit and her maid.
All but friends.
He is the fool who is trying to get rid of his heart-stricken injuries.
Nothing can be called deformed, but the unkind.
None of these things is offending, I say, none.
Nothing good, my liege, to please you with the hearing, nor none so bad, but good may be reported.
I am not the man in the world.
None of these rogues and cowards, but Ajax is their fool.
I know that nothing will be the same as anything else.
I love nothing more than myself.
None, Brutus, none.
Nothing, but your beauty.
None, man.
None, my lord.
None.
Nor anyone.
This wood does not have worlds of company, because you are all the world.
I have never heard, nor suspect.
You are not alone.
I will not go either way.
It is not Loveâ€™s mind of judgment that has any judgment tasteâ€” wings and no eyes are heedless.
I have not seen more than you, dear friend, and I can call men.
Heaven and earth have been in peace tonight.
I do not know where I was last night.
I am neither, by this heavenly light.
I am neither.
I am neither.
I do not know how you have done it.
I am not my lord.
I am not my lord.
I am not my lord.
I am not.
I am not.
I am not.
Nor in your heart.
He is not dead, for aught that I can tell.
I donâ€™t know what I am doing, but he is well and will be here in the coming weeks.
I do not know what I am saying or doing this night, unless self-charity is sometimes a vice, and to defend ourselves it is a sin when violence assails us.
It is not the only thing that should be done in this way.
Nor does anyone else.
There is no one here, because curses never pass the lips of those who breathe them in the air.
I hope there is no one who lives there.
Nor does nothing in your letters writ her?
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
Do you send you out of your way?
It will not be until necessity is served.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit.
We cannot tear tears or pray for abuses, therefore we cannot use them.
I am not doing anything by water.
I will not do anything tomorrow.
I will not.
You will not tell me who you are.
You will not be able to do less.
We would not deign him burial of his men until he gave up at Saint Colmeâ€™s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
You are not loyal, as we are.
I am not sure there is no force in eyes that can hurt.
Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, we must not?
Normans, but Normans, Normans!
Noses, ears, and lips.
It was a drop before.
We are not a dump.
It is not a false gallop.
Not a hair perished.
I am not a jot more, my lord.
It is not a jot, not a jot.
It is not a mouse stirring.
Not a soul but a fever of the madness and played some tricks of desperation.
Not a whit, Touchstone.
It is not a whit.
It is not a whit.
I am not a word of mine.
It is not a word.
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy can buy this precious maid of me.
Not so, sir.
He is not Fortune, he is a minister of her will.
Not being the worst is a good thing.
I am not black, though yellow in my legs.
Not Caesarâ€™s valor has oâ€™erthrown Antony, but Antonyâ€™s triumph has triumphed on itself.
Not Cassio killed!
Not dead?
I would not be guilty of a sin for all this land.
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
Not for the world.
You are not a fairy kingdom.
It is not that short.
He is not so, Mark Antony.
I do not know her who chides her, sir, at any hand, I pray.
I am not here in presence.
I love Helena, not Hermia.
I will not be ashamed of myself, my lord.
I am not, but my affairs have made you wait.
I am not, believe me.
I am not, believe me.
I am not, believe me.
I am not I, I must be found.
I am not my lord.
I am not I, my lord.
I am not I, my lord.
I am not I, sir.
I am not alone, except when the heartick groans, sour, are squeezing me from the search of eyes.
I am not.
I am not a fool.
Not if the small come first.
Not in a grave, to lay one in a grave, another to have.
I am not doing anything, madam, because I can do nothing but to make sure I do what is honest.
Are you not in love, neither?
I am not in my house, Lucentio, because you know that Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
I am not in my husbandâ€™s nose.
Not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top Macbeth.
He will not be able to stay in this land.
Do you know me yet?
I do not know my voice.
Not life, but love in death.
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is, Shut up in prison, kept without my food, whipped and tormented andâ€”Good e'en, good fellow.
Now you are not going to hear them sing.
Not now, sweet Desdemona.
Not now.
You are not on your sole, but on your soul, harsh Jew, you make your knife a bit slick.
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
There is no dog to throw at.
I am not one, my lord.
Isnâ€™t it poppy, mandragora, or all the drowsy syrups of the world?
It is not possible.
You are not proud of yourself, but thankful for you.
I am sorry, my lord.
He has not been seen since?
Do you think today is not the best thing to do?
Not sick, my lord, unless it is in mind, nor well, unless it is in mind.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Not so hot.
Not so sick, my lord, as she is struggling with a series of ill-looking fancies that keep her from her rest.
I am not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dot her for anything.
If not, I will be astonishing your Majesty.
Not so, my lord.
Not so, my lord.
Not so.
Not so.
Not so, not so.
I do not care for something.
Not so.
Not stingless too?
It will never be a show of the full-fortuned Caesar.
He came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bids you forsake your liberty.
I know that.
I do not love you.
We do not love words better than you.
I hope you did not get that from me.
Not this, but the problems of the marriage bed.
It is not until God makes men of some other metal than earth.
It is not until you have slept.
If you are abed after midnight, you will be able to be abed, and I know that I am not.
It is not to be endured.
He is not his father.
He is not killed, but he is damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend me.
He will not be able to think about the fault My father made in compassing the crown.
I am not tonight, good Iago.
Not too fast!
I have met him oft, and he has bought the cottage and the bounds of the old carlot.
We are not.
I didnâ€™t see it when I saw it.
He is not where he is, but where he is eaten.
Not with salt tears.
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before a peass, or a codling when a squash is almost an apple.
Not yet dead?
Not yet, my cousin.
Not yet.
It is now here.
Not?
Notable pirate!
Note him, note him, good Charmian, he is the man, but note him.
If your lady is a bit irritated, please do not forget to stop him.
Note this before my notes: There is no note of mine that is worth noting.
Nothing at all.
What is it that will cause you to suffer from her being afoul of me?
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
Nothing but songs of death.
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
Nothing can be made from nothing.
Nothing certainer.
Nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness, but his unkind daughters.
Nothing extenuates, nor sets aught in a sham.
Nothing in his life was like leaving it.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
Nothing that can be done can come between me and my hopes.
Nothing I respect, my gracious lord.
Nothing that is so is so.
Nothing will come from nothing.
Nothing, but that is the case.
Nothing to do with Cavalery Cobweb.
Nothing, madam.
Nothing, Messala.
Nothing, my lord, or ifâ€”I know what.
Nothing, my lord.
Nothing, my lord.
Nothing, unless you render her again.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Use your pleasure.
Now, if I am a drunkard, I will put our Cassio in some action that may offend the sleeve.
A little fire in a wild field was like a lecherâ€™s heartâ€”a small spark, all the rest on his body cold.
Now everything is good.
Now all you have to do is work Mars.
Now all the blessings of a glad father, you will be glad.
Now all the plagues that plagued your daughters in the pendulous air will be borne by men.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, and there lies a silky sleeve in the wardrobe.
I am dead.
I am now a man who is unbound.
Antony must leave her completely.
We are ready to know the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin, because we hear your greeting is from him, not from the king.
Now you are my lieutenant.
Now you are Romeo.
Now you are sociable.
Now attest that those who you called fathers had you.
Now boast you, Death, in your possession, you have a lass that is unparalleled.
Now by my George, my Garter, and my crownâ€” profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.
By my life, old fools are babes again and must be used with checks as flatteries when they are seen abused.
Now civil wounds are stopped, peace is again alive.
Now comes the bloody blood up in your cheeks.
Now could I drink hot blood and do so bitter business as the bitter day would be.
If you are not, you should be ashamed, ashamed, and a murderer.
Now die, die, die, die die.
I donâ€™t see if it is true.
Now know the reason for this rapidity.
Now I am going to be a big fan.
Now Edmund, where is the villain?
Now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the dark fills the large vessel of the universe.
Now you are good, sir.
I will try to start again.
If you do, you will have to try to determine which right is most in Helena.
Now, Lord Constable and princes, we will soon be able to speak of Englandâ€™s fall.
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant.
Now go your way.
Go to the door and stay there till we call.
Now we are in the mood to freedom, and not to banishment.
Now God in heaven bless you!
Now gods that we love, where is this coming from?
Have I done a good dayâ€™s work?
Now he begins the story.
He denies it and laughs it out.
Now he importates him to tell it o'er.
He is a praying.
Now he tells me how she plucked him in my chamber.
Now he will outseat the lightning.
Now heaven has all.
Now heaven will help him!
Now heaven walks on earth.
I am alone.
I am here.
I start with: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress.
I change my mind, and credit things that do not prey on me.
I feed myself with the most delicious poison.
I must to the young man send humble treaties, dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness, who had half the bulk of my world played as I pleased, making and marring fortunes.
I think they have all three conjoined me to fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
I see in Fulviaâ€™s death how I will receive mine.
I will now believe that there are unicorns, that in Arabia there is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix at this hour reigning there.
Now I will tell you without asking.
Now, Gratiano, you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.
Now that it is in the fields, it will be good for me.
Now he is for the numbers that Petrarch flies in.
Is it Rome, and there is enough room, when there is only one man.
Now is the time to arm.
Now is the day we have long been looking for.
Now is the sun on the highest hill of this dayâ€™s journey, and from nine to twelve she is three hours long, yet she is not coming.
Now is the time for help.
Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York, and all the clouds that sat on our house in the deep bosom of the ocean were buried.
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, sends you a beard!
Now know you, Casca, I have moved some of the noblest-minded Romans to undergo a mission of honorable-dangerous consequence.
Let it work.
Let me see if I can do it.
Now let your friendly hand put strength enough to tame it.
Letâ€™s have a catch.
He is there, and none of those poor people are so poor to give him reverence.
Lord, be grateful for my good amends.

Poor and content is rich enough, and rich enough, but riches are as poor as winter to him that ever fears he will be poor.
Poor Antony!
Poor bird!
Poor heart, adieu.
Poor I am, but his staleness.
Poor lady, she will run mad when she will be missing it.
Poor living corse, closed in a dead manâ€™s tomb.
Poor man!
Poor men alone?
Poor Ophelia slid from herself and her fair judgment, and we would not be pictures, or mere beasts.
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why do you sugar on that bottled spider, Whose deadly web ensnareth you?
Poor prattler, how do you talk?
Poor soul, your face is abused with tears.
Poor soul!
Poor souls, they died.
Poor Tom has been scared out of his good wits.
Poor Tom will lead you.
Poor Tom, your horn is dry.
Poor Tom.
Poor Turlygod!â€ â€œPoor Tom!â€â€” Thatâ€™s something yet.
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch.
Portia is dead.
Portia, adieu.
Portia, you have gone?
Oh, forgive me this enforcÃ©d wrong, and when I hear these friends say hello to you, even by your own fair eyes.
What is your name?
Possess them not with fear.
Post back with speed and tell him what he has done.
Post to Salisbury.
Post-post-haste, dispatch.
Pour in the blood of the murderer, who has eaten her nine farrows, and grease that is sweaty from the murdererâ€™s gibbet throw into the flame.
Pour on, I will endure.
Pox on â€™t!
Pray to be God, and not our strength, for it!

Pray now, rest yourself.
Pray you, corporal, stay.
Pray you, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
Pray you, marry us.
Pray you, sweet Mistress Margaret, and you deserve good things in my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
Pray you, take pain to get rid of some cold drops of modesty, so that through your wild behavior I will be misconstripped in the place I go to, and lose my hopes.
Pray, go.
Pray, sir?
Pray you are ever known to patience.

Pray you, no more of that.
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
Pray you, sir, stand up.
Pray you, sit down, and we sit for now to chat and eat.
Pray you, tell him I am his fortuneâ€™s vassal, and I send him the greatness he has got.
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall.
Pray, chuck, come here.
Pray, do not mock me.
Pray, give me that.
Pray, have you not a daughter called Katherina, fair and virtuous?
Pray, set it down and rest you.
Pray, sir, be patient.
Pray, then, foresee me one.
Pray, what do you think is his name?
Pray, write down, â€œBorachio.â€
Prepare the body and follow us.
Prepare us for our marriage
Prepare you, generals.
Prescribe not us our duty.
He is now away, because strangely they strain the cure. Come, lady, die to live.
What is happening today?
He is in the works.
Press near him and second him.
Pretty soul!
Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all.
Prince Dauphin, you will stay with us in Rouen.
Prince John is stolen this morning secretly.
Princes and counties!
Princes have only their titles for their glories, An outward honor for an inward toil.
Prison, my lord?
I am a little devoted to Prithee.
Prithee says true!
Prithee, away.
Be cheerful.
Be content.
Do not be angry.
Prithee, dispatch.
Do not turn me around.
Prithee, Emilia, go know Cassio where he supped tonight.
Prithee, friend, preheat the ear to mine, the good and bad together.
Go in your way.
How many boys and wenches do I have?
If you love me, tell me.
Keep up your quillets.
Prithee, listen well.
Prithee, my king, be quiet.
No more.
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.

Prithee, say on.
Prithee, see there!
Who is that you mean?
Continue, Moon.
Proceed, proceed.
Proceed, Solinus, to get my fall, and by the doom of death end woes and all.
Proceed.
Proculeius, what have you done to your master Caesar?
Promise me life, and I will confess the truth.
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, because my heart speaks they are welcome.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
Pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall when there is no strength in men.
Pronounce.
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to remove Hero and kill Leonato.
I thank you, I thank you, and I thank you not, but I am not proud.
If I lose more blood with love than I will ever get again with drinking, pick my eyes up with a ballad makerâ€™s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind
Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, that I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

Pyramus draws near the wall.
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
Quarrel, sir?
Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood, the one you bendd against her breast, but your brothers beat aside the point.
Question enrages him.
Question it, Horatio.
Ask your Grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy, how well supplied with noble counselors, how modest in exception, and how terrible in constant resolution.
Question: Why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.
Quick, quick!
Let me have it.
Send your message to your castle, for my e-mail is about Lear and Cordelia.
You are a good man.
Is that dumb?
Quot my master.
Rage, blow!
Raise up the Montagues.
You have been a long time ago slammed.
Rapier and dagger.
Rarely, rarely.
Ratcliffe, about midnight, come to my tent and help me arm me.
Ratcliffe, come here.
Ratcliffe, my lord, is I.
Ratcliffe!
If you are a ditch in Egypt, you will be a gentle grave to me.
I would rather approach it too late!
Instead, make my countryâ€™s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains!
Instead of letting the waterflies blow me into a mud, lay me naked.
You should not look at his judgment.
Read it instantly.
Read it, great Caesar.
Read it, Mark Antony!
Read it.
Read the will!
Read the will.
You have to take this challenge.
Read.
Ready to go, but never to return.
Ready, my lord.
Please, please, please.
Ready.
Ready.
Realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket.
Rebellious dead, rise never until the wood of Birnam rises, and our high-placed Macbeth will live the lease of nature, pay his breath to time and mortal custom.
Rebellions it at these years?
I will do it.
Receive what you want.
Do not use it.
Refuse not this proffered love, mighty lord.
Regan, I hope you didnâ€™t know what you said.
Regan, I think you are.
I will tell you what you are doing about the field.
Relent, and save your souls.
Hermia is sweet and sweet, and Lysander is able to give me a certain title.
Are you still waiting?
Rest in darkness.
Remember to first possess his books, because without them, he is not as good as I am, nor has he no one to command.
Remember it, my lord?
Remember March, remember the ides of March.
Remember me.
Remember me.
Remember our reward when the act is done.
Remember that you call me today.
Remember you!
Remember what I said.
Remember who commended your yellow stockings â€” â€œYour yellow stockings?
Remember that you have died on a teddy bear?
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Renown and grace are dead.
RenownÃ¨d duke, vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us here and hear at large discourse on all our fortunes, and all that is assembled in this place that by this sympathizÃ¨d sympa
Repair your wit, good youth, or it will fall to cureless ruin.
Is he a great man with such a deep shame?
Repent but you will lose your friend, and he will not pay your debt.
Repent that you have so betrayed your tongue.
Reply not.
Report is changeable.
Repose you there, while I go to this hard house, more difficult than the stones where tis raised, which even now, demanding after you, denied me to come in, will return and force their scathing 
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking our plumes.
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
Reserve them until a merrier hour than this.
Rest you happy!
Rest you merry!
Retire you, go where you are.
Retire us.
Retire!
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?
Return with her?
Return you to my sister.
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.
Isnâ€™t it so soon?
Revenge his ill-fated and unnatural murder.
Revenge.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes would cause the bleeding and the alarm to excite the mortified man.
Revolving this will teach you how to curse.
Richard, except those who we fight against would rather win than him.
Richard loves Richard
Richard of York, how does our loving brother behave?
Richard lives, hellâ€™s black intelligencer, only reserved their factor to buy souls and send them to the end.
Richard!
Richmond is on the seas.
Isnâ€™t it?
Ride to the horsemen on a hill.
Ride you this afternoon?
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills to the legions on the other side.
Ride, ride, Messala.
I am so glad he was not at this fray.
Right now, you are the most worthy brother England.
It is your son Lucentio here who loves my daughter and she loves him, or both of them dissemble deeply their affections.
Right, dear madam.
Right, as snow in harvest.
Right, I mean you.
Ring the bell.
To be engulfed with those vows that break themselves in swearing!
Rise and lend your ear.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbeâ€™s mother.
Roderigo killed?
Roderigo!
Rogue, you have lived too long.

Romeo can, although heaven cannot.
Romeo is banishÃ¨d.
Romeo is coming.
Romeo is not allowed to live.
Romeo will thank you, daughter, for us both.
Romeo slammed him
Romeo slammed Tybalt.
Romeo will answer it.
Romeo, away, be gone!
Come forth.
Romeo, he screams loud, â€œHold, friends!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
Romeo, will you come to your fatherâ€™s house?
Romeo!
Romeo!
Romeo!
Romeo.
Romeo is a dishclout.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony!
Room, ho!
Room!
Rosalind is your loveâ€™s name?
Rosalind is not the one who tells you that you are one.
Rosalind is a better leerer than you.
It is a bit of a fault.
I answered with a sigh.
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Royal Lear, Who I have ever honored as my king, Loved as my father, as my master followed me, as my great patron thought on in my prayers.
Royal Queen!
Royal wench!
Rub him about the temples.
I am a ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow.
Rumble your bellyfulls!
It is rumored that my wife is very sick.
Run after that peevish messenger, the countyâ€™s man.
Run away, I pray you!
Run, proclaim, cry about the streets.
Run one before and let the Queen know of our gests.
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
Run to the Capulets.
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, pray to the gods to stop the plague that needs to be eradicated.
Run, master, run.
Run, run, run, run!
Sad, lady!
Saddle my horses.
He is safe in a ditch, with twenty trenches on his head, the least a death to nature.
Safe, Antony.
Safely stowed.
Safer than trust too far.
He said he was not so?
Have you said so?
Sailor, my lord.
Saint Davyâ€™s day is past.
Saint Francis is my speed!

Satan, avoid!
Save means to live.
Save you, Curan.
Save you, friend, and your music.
Save you, friend Cassio!
Save you, gentleman.
Save you, worthy general!
Here is the note on how much your chain weighs to the highest carat, how fine the gold is and how it is a slapstick, which is more than I am debted to this gentleman.
Who is there?
Have you seen anything?
Did you see him today?
Have you seen me?
Did you see you no more?
Have you seen you as the king today, my lord of Derby?
Have you seen the weird sisters?
Saw you enter here?
Isnâ€™t you the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
Say that is not the case, a province I will give you and make your fortunes proud.
Say â€œa dayâ€ without the â€œever.â€ No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are
Say again, where did you leave these varlets?
Say boldly.
Say either, and I will stay in the same situation.
Say from when you owe this strange intelligence, or why you stop our way on this blasted heath with such prophetic greetings.
Say I am sick.
Say I will love her forever.
Say I am her sovereign, and she is her subject.
Say it is done, and I will love you and prefer you for it.
Say it, Othello.
Say it is not, Agrippa.
Say it is not.
Say goodbye, my loving lord.
Say our pleasure, to such a place that is under us, requires our quick removal from hence.
Say she is mute and will not speak a word
Say she will be a high and mighty queen.
Say that I did all this for love of her.
Say that I sat with you at your shop to see the making of her carcanet, and that tomorrow you will bring it home.
Say that I slew them out.
Say that I wish he never found more reason to change a master.
Say that she is a frightened woman
Say that she is a sailor
Say that some lady, as well as maybe there is, has a great heart for you.
Say that the last I spoke was â€œAntony,â€ and say it, prithee, indignately.
Say they are unable to do their job.
Say that you overheard us, and bid her to steal into the sand of the bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites Made proud by princes, that
Say that you love me not, but say that you are bitter.
Say then my peace is made.
Say this becomes him, as he is rare, and he must be able to hide his foils when we bear so much weight in his lightness.
Say you are not alone, and that bare vowel is more than the eye of cockatrice.
Say to me who will rise higher than Caesarâ€™s or mine?
Say to the king I would be able to take a few words to his leisure.
Say to the king the knowledge of the broiler as you left it.
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
Say what, is Horatio there?
Say you have wronged her, sir.
Say you so?
Say you?
Say, â€œthe brave Antony.â€ The valiant Caesar!
Say, have you consented to die?
Say, how much is it going to be?
Say, how is that?
Say, if you had rather heard it from our mouths, or from our masters.
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Say, my spirit, how far the king and his followers are going?
If our brother comes, where will we sojourn till our coronation?
Say, Voltemand, what is our brother Norway?
What?
Say it, friend?
Say you so?
Say you are dark.
Sblood, an arrant traitor as any other in the universal world, or in France, or in England.
You will not hear me.
Do you think I am more likely to be played on than a pipe?
If philosophy could find it, there is something more natural in this than natural.
I do not make my cups, and make me as much as when mine was your fellow, and suffered my command.
Scape being drunk for wine.
You are saying it.
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, and anything that may not be a bad thing to the sender, he will be a good judge.
Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily.
I am snatching my head, Peaseblossom.
It was a tad like yours.
Scurvy knave!
Scurvy knave!
Seafaring men, sir.
Seal then, and all is done. Eros!
Seal the mouth of outrage for a while, until we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring, their head, their true descent.
Search every acre in the high-grown field, and bring him to our eyes.
Search, seek, and know how this murder comes.
I searched the window for a flint and found this paper, which was sealed up, and I am sure it didn't lie there when I went to bed.
Season your admiration for a while with an attentive ear, until I can deliver this marvel to you upon the witness of these gentlemen.
Sebastian?
Sebastian was my father
Security gives way to conspiracy.
You are better, Lear, and let me remain the true blank of your eye.
See for the news.
See him delivered, Fabian
See how beastly she is courting him.
See how she snuck her cheek on her hand.
See how they kiss and court!
See how justice is wrought upon a simple thief.
See it done and feast the army.
I will never see him again, whether he is dead or not.
See not your bride in these unreverent robes.
I will give you more instructions.
You do not see you dissembling.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.
See where he looks out of the window.
See where his Grace stands, he has tween two clergymen.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
See where she comes from with a merry look.
See where they come from.
See, and then speak yourself.
See, Caesar!
He breathes?
Here he comes.
It stalks away.
You, my women, can stop their nose against the rose that sank to the buds.
Here is the man we went to seek.
See, see, our honored hostess!
You will be able to thank them with their hearts' thanks.
Who comes here?
You are with your wife.
You will never see it.
Seek him, ask him to come here.
I will meet him, Titinius, while I will meet the noble Brutus, thrusting this report into his ears.
See it out.
Seek your own ease.
Do not want to know more.
Seek, seek for him, and let his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it.
See!
Are they religious?
Isnâ€™t it?
You are here, this is the mouth of your cell.
What is this sweet sight?
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt
Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.
Send him for him, good uncle.
Send to the county.
Send for the man and ask him.
Send him but hither and I will fashion him.
Send one to Sir Toby.
Send out more horses.
Send the act after me, and I will sign it.
Send your man away.
Send your token of reprieve.
Send him to his brother.
Sent he to Macduff?
Servant-monster?
Serve God, love me, and mend.
Serve God.
Serve you, sir.
Service.
Set down your venerable burden, and let him feed.
Set down, set down your honorable load, if you are a savage man, while I obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Set him up before me.
Set it up for a while.
Set it down.
Set me the stoups of wine on that table.
Set me where you are.
Set on your wife to observe.
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
Set our squadrons on a hill, in the eye of Caesarâ€™s battle, and then proceed accordingly.
Set you down this,
Set your countenance, sir.
Set your heart at rest.
Seven days and nights?
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make him happy.
Sextus Pompeius s'approches to Rome.
Seyton!
Seyton!â€”I am sick at heart, when I beholdâ€”Seyton, I say!â€”This push will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
Shake it off.
Shake off this sleepy sleep, deathâ€™s counterfeit, and look on death itself.
Shake!â€ quoth the dovehouse.
Shall he be tonight at supper?
What is Caesar's lie?
Isnâ€™t it better than a sty?
Shall I attend your Grace?
Isnâ€™t it fright when a madman stares?
Shall I be married tomorrow morning?
Isnâ€™t I plain?
Isnâ€™t I going to be tempted by the devil?
Isnâ€™t it that death is a savage death?
Isnâ€™t I going to deny you?
Shall I descend?
Shall I do such a thing?
Shall I do what all the Parthian darts, although enemy, lost aim and could not do?
Isnâ€™t I going to be able to do something?
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
Shall I win my daughter to your will?
Have I had some water?
Have I thought I should think about this, and will I think that a thing that is not a good thing would make me sad?
Isnâ€™t I hearing from you anon?
Isnâ€™t it possible to keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
Do I know your answer?
Shall I lay a burden on my soul?
Shall I play my freedom at the tray-trip and become your bondslave?
What do you want from him?
I will tell you, â€œLet them be free!
Shall I speak a word in your ears?
Isnâ€™t I a partisan?
Shall I strike now?
Why?
Do I tell her that you are coming?
Will Kate be my wife?
It will not be long, but I will be here again.
Shall they hoist me up and show me the shrieking scream of censuring Rome?
Shall they see us?
Shall we be sundered?
Do we call your ambassador, my liege?
Shall we clap into a tense position without hawking, spitting or saying we are hoarsing, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?
Shall we do that?
Do we give o'er and drown?
Do we see the relics of this town?
Do we go to Benedick and tell him about her love?
Well send them dinners and fresh suits, and give them a provender, and after fighting with them?
Shall we go, coz?
Do we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
Were we not, Sir Andrew?
Do we?
Do we play, sweet girl?
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver?
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
Shall we shog?
Shall we sound him?
Will we see their fond pageant?
Shall we get to court?
Shall you, Antipholus, even in the spring of love your love-springs rot?
You will see your other daughter use you kindly.
Shame come to Romeo!
Shame itself!
Shame on ladies, sisters!
Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
She ate no meat today, nor will she eat it.
She asks you to come to her.
She cannot be so much without a judgmental attitude, having a wit so swift and excellent as she is prized to have, as to refuse a gentleman so rare as Signior Benedick.
She cannot refuse it.
She cannot endure to hear a story about a husband.
She cannot love, nor do she have any shape or a desire to be so self-deared.
She confesses it.
She creeps.
She wants to speak with you in her closet if you go to bed.
She praised my yellow stockings of late, she praised my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and drives me to these habits of her liking.
She did.
She showed favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, awaken your dormouse valor, fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
She died, my lord, but she lived while her slander was uncovered.
She dies for it.
She stÃ¶ÃŸt a little about by a holy cross, where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours.
She does well.
She is false with Cassio.
She is a slew, and I am a slew, and I am a slew, and she is not a slew.
She gave it to him, and he gave it to him.
She gives it Cassio?
She tells you that you will marry her.
She had a fear of what has come to pass.
She had a song of â€œWillow,â€ an old thing, but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it.
She has defrauded her father, and may you.
She is constantly light by her.
She has robbed me of my sword.
She has spoken what she does not want to do.
She has betrayed me and will die the death.
She has good leave.
She has not seen the change of fourteen years.
She has stopped me.
She has spied him already with those sweet eyes.
She has the stones on her, and the ducats.
She has a great reputation, and in that she makes huge wastes for beauty, starved with her severity, and cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She haunts me in every place.
She appeared in thâ€™habiliments of the goddess Isis that day, and oft gave audience, as tis reported.
She is a royal princess.
She is a virtuous and reverend lady.
She is banished.
She is a savage man.
She is damned for it.
She is daughter of this famous Duke of Milan, whom I have heard so often remarkable but never seen before.
She is dead.
She is drowned with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
She is herself a dowry.
She is a perfectionist.
She is low-voiced.
She is never sad, but when she sleeps, and not ever sad, because I have heard my daughter say she has dreamed of unhappiness and wakes herself with laughing.
She is not well.
She is not worth you.
She is not madam.
She is so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness to do not do more than she is requested.
She is our capital demand, comprised within the forerank of our articles.
She is convinced I will marry her, because she is her own love and flattery, and not because I promise her.
She is a protector of her honor.
She is spherical, like a globe.
She is stirring.
She is yours.
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
She is too fair, too wise, too fair, to make me feel like I am a good man.
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.
She lives.
She loved me for the dangers I had passed, and I loved her that she did pity them.
She loves me, sure!
She made good use of me, and I thought her eyes had lost her tongue, because she did not speak in the beginnings.
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
She must change for youth.
She will now be my sister, not my wife.
She pounces on me.
She gave life, and that is the name she had so buried in her.
She replied that it should be better he became her guest, which she sat down with.
She returns this ring to you, sir.
She robs you of your name, and you will show more bright and appear more virtuous when she is gone.
She said so.
She says enough, yet she is a simple savage.
She says you have some good snoot in hand.
She sent you home by Dromio to dinner.
She will be buried by her Antony.
She will be buried with her face upwards.
She will not harm you, Helena.
She will not.
She will, Lucentio.
She would have died hereafter.
She shows a body rather than a life, a statue than a breather.
She will soon know how honorable and kindly we are for her, because Caesar cannot live to be ungentle.
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs.
She speaks, but she doesnâ€™t say anything.
She speaks.
She stood and spake.
She swoons to see them bleed.
She thanked me and baded me, if I had a friend who loved her, I would only teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her.
She calls me husband, even my soul calls me a wife.
She will sliver and disbranch herself from her material sap and come to use.
She makes a dreadful appearance, I will swear she has corns.

She is a beagle, true-bred, and adores me.
She is a triumphant lady, if she is honest.

Sheathe your dagger.
Shed no blood, nor cut you less or more, but just a pound of flesh.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, so I can see my shadow as I pass.
I will be able to work in a short time, and you will be free.
Should be â€œshould beâ€â€”should buzz!
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?
Should I lie, madam?
Should I say, â€œHas a dog money?
We should not be able to take our course up.
If you do so, my lord, my speech should be a success that my thoughts did not.
Show the way, sir.
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
Show me how.
Show me the place.
Show me which way.
Show me, my women, like a queen.
Show me, show me.
Show.
Shut doors after you.
Shut that, and twill out at the keyhole.
Shut up your doors, my lord.
Shut up your doors.
Shylock is my name.
Shylock, though I do not lend nor borrow by taking or giving out excess, yet to supply the ripe desires of my friend, I will break a custom.

Shylock, there are a lot of money you have offered.
Sick, oh, sick!

Silence!
Silence!
He finds you in the stout Norweyan ranks, nothing afeasing of what you did, Strange images of death.
Silver.
Simple, simple Clarence, I love you so that I will send your soul in KÃ¼rze to heaven, if heaven will take the present at our hands.
What is your sin from your lips?
Since Cassius first whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such a dishonor that the gods detest my baseness.
Since he has got the jewel that I loved, and that you swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you.
Since he went from Egypt, it is a space for further travel.
Since he went into France, I have been practicing continuously.
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take out paper, fold it, write on it, read it, then seal it
Since I am not happy with myself, I will keep it with little cost.
Since I came here, which I can call, I have heard strange news.
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will be able to make it a priority.
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her, her election has sealed you for herself, because you have been a man who has been suffering all that suffers nothing.
Since my young lady is going into France, sir, the fool has been a bit slammed away.
Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is going on to leave?
Since my beauty cannot please his eye, I will weep what is left away and weep.
Since respects and fortunes are his love, I will not be his wife.
Since the torch is out, lie down and stray no farther.

Since they did plot the means that dusky Dis my daughter got, I have forsworn her and her blind boyâ€™s scandalous company.
Since you have this fortune, you will be content and seek no new.
Since you give me pains, let me remember what you have promised, which is not yet performed me.
Sinful Macduff, they were all struck for you!
Donâ€™t forget to sing it tonight.
Sing it.
Sink Rome!
Sir, I will whip you from your fence, Nay, as I am a gentleman.
Sir John Falstaff.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender of my childâ€™s love.
Sir Toby Belch!
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.
Sir Toby, I must be round with you.
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

Sir Topas!
Sir Walter Herbert, a renommated soldier
Sir, a whole history.
Sir, a word you go.
Sir, amen.
Sir, are you my father?
Sir, being his knave, I will.
Sir, by your patience, if I heard you rightly, the duke has put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court.
Sir, do you know me?
Sir, you are good.
Sir, good success.
Sir, do not grieve you.
Sir, sorry, I will be his surety.
Sir, he answered me in the most round manner he would ever have done.
Sir, he dined with her at the Porpentine.
Sir, he is with Caesar.
Sir, he may live.
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and may strike you haply.
Sir, hereâ€™s the door.
Sir, his chests and treasures are not with him.
Sir, his definition is not a perdition in you, though I know that dividing him in a way that would dizzy memory, and yet neither would you, in respect of his quick sail.
Sir, I am vexed.
Sir, I bade them take you away.
Sir, I cannot.
Sir, I encourage you to do so.
Sir, I know you, and I will do my best to thank you for a great job.
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
Sir, I am not a big fan.
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
Sir, I never loved you much, but I praised you for being so good that you deserve ten times more than I said you did.
Sir, I say you are false knaves.
Sir, I say you are none.
Sir, I will meet you in your career, and you will be fined for it.
Sir, I will study worthy.
Sir, I will answer any question.
Sir, in Argier.
Sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood to his unnatural purpose, in fell motion, he charges my unprovided body, latched mine arm.
Sir, in good faith, or in sincere reassurance, you will be able to influence you, who is your influence, like the wreath of radiant fire on Phoebus' front.
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep.
Sir, know you this glove?
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
Sir, Mark Antony Will eâ€™en will kiss Octavia, and weâ€™ll follow.
Sir, I am very attentive.
Sir, my good friend, I will change that name with you.
Sir, my liege, do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business.
Sir, no.
Sir, Octavius is already coming to Rome.
Sir, please, let me know what I have to say.
Sir, will I speak to this lady?
Sir, she can turn, turn, turn, and turn again.
Sir, she is mortal.
Sir, sir, be patient.
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, to your shame, I doubt it.
Sir, sir, sir.
Sir, sir, that is not the case.
Sir, sooth to say, you did not have dinner at home.
Sir, you are going to be a good one.
Sir, the gods will have it.
Sir, the Queen.
Sir, there is a special commission coming from Venice to depute Cassio in Othelloâ€™s place.
Sir, there she is.
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
Sir, this is the matter â€” I beg you, remember â€” Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, this should be answered.
Sir, will you, with those infirmities she owes, unfriended, adopted to our hate, shattered with our curse and strangered with our oath, take her or leave her?
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips as much as she gives me as much as she gives me as much as she does.
Sir, you and I must play, but that is not the case.
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
Sir, you say well, and you do not know what you are doing.
Sir, you speak nobly.
Sir!
Sir?
Sir?
Sirrah young gamester, your father was a fool to give you all and in his waning age set foot under your table.
Sirrah, come hither: 'It is no time to jest, and therefore frame your manners to the time.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet tis that sounds.
Sirrah, I will teach you a speech.
Sirrah, naked fellow, Poor Tom.
Sirrah, your father is dead.
Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.
Sirs, letâ€™s not be alone.
Sirs, take the corse.
Sister, I am content with my discontent. Sir, to your pleasure, I subscribe.
Sister, have comfort.
Sister, it is not a little I have to say about what is most appertiously appertiable to us both.
Sister, welcome.
Sister, where are you?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.
Sister, you will go with us?
Sit down a while and let us assail your ears, that are so strong against our story, what we have seen two nights.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
Sit down and rest.
Sit i' th' middle.
Sit down, Clitus.
Sit then and talk with her.
Sit you too.
Sit, Jessica.
Sit, sir.
Sit, worthy friends.
Sit.
I never thought that lady would have loved any man.
Sitting on a bank, weeping again the king my fatherâ€™s wrack, this music crept by me upon the waters, laying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air.
Six thousand are their greatest power.
Skipper, stand back.
Slanders, sir.
Slave!
Slay!
Sleep a little.
Sleep on your eyes, and you will find peace in your breast.
Sleep will neither night nor day hang on his penthouse lid.
Sleep, and I will wind you in my arms.
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
Slid, I will again beat him.
Isnâ€™t you going to make an ass o' me?
Small cheer and welcome make a merry feast.
I am a small joy in being Englandâ€™s queen.
Smatter with your gossips, go.
Smile heaven on this fair conjunction, who have long been a fan of their enmity.
Smile you as I was a fool?
Smilest you?
Sneck up!
You are right.
All hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
All that is right.
I am purposed.
The Prince and Claudio, who accused her of a misunderstanding, are all the same.
And those crisp, snaky golden locks that make such wanton gambols with the wind, are known to be the dowry of a second head, the skull that bred them in the sepul
You are all princes.
You are going to be revenge when you hear it.
Be gone.
Letâ€™s go.
I am so sick of this false story that he burdens me with a lot of pain.
You are blessed, master.
Caesar will.
Call the field to rest, and letâ€™s go away to take the joys of this happy day.
I can do it.
Chrish, save me, I will cut your head off.
I can do that.
I would have the hope of having the next wish after that, that Lucentio had Baptistaâ€™s youngest daughter.
I loved the man that I must weep.
She is so delicate with her needle, an admirable musician.
I did, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
You were my liege.
All thoughts are welcome.
If I cursed now, I would have cursed myself.
I do.
I do, my lord.
I do not.
I do not.
We drench their limbs in blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and yerk out their armÃ¨d heels at their dead
So do the kings of France, Howbeit, until today, they would hold up this law to stop your Highness from claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than to imbar their 
You do, where you see them thick.
The greater glory dims the less.
Every bondman in his own hand has the power to cancel his captivity.
You are so good at it, because Brutus' tongue has almost ended his lifeâ€™s history.
You will be happy until we meet again.
You are good.
Thank you to you and your family.
You are so foolish that you will be able to do so.
He was so angry when he smashed the sledded Polacks on the ice.
It is so big that it is so big.
Fulvia told me.
Get you in peace.
God sa' me, it is shame to stand still.
Good night to you all.
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to â€™t.
They are friends to Antony.
My lord has eured him to fight.
He does.
He laughed and let me go.
He served the second, and so the third.
Help me to every spirit sanctified as I have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech.
Oh, ho!
Take my leave.
I am free.
I am to let him live.
I charmed their ears that, like I said, my lowing followed through briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse and thorns, which entered their frail shins
I do, madonna.
I do.
I hope so.
I give her a call and she gives me a call, because I am rough and woo not like a babe.
I will, my liege, live as I live.
I am now young and unable to reason.
I lose myself, to find a mother and a brother, in search of them, unhappy.
So in the world.
He did.
He is now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise, but he is still in this late form.
Lysander.
Is mine?
I have Octavius, my horse, and for that I have Octavius.
So is the bargain.
So is the dearest loss.
The fame.
I have to say that.
It should be that none except Antony should conquer Antony, but we will do it!
Isnâ€™t it a father?
Let a blind man run on the fence till each man drops by lottery.
Let him land, and see him go on to London.
Let it be with Caesar.
So long?
My tongue is still and mute.
Yes, it is.
You may lose your arms.
He is so happy.
I will be able to show you how much I appreciate myself.
So much for this, sir.
He was so happy.
We are womenâ€™s men.
So out of the candle we were left dark.
Maybe you did.
Please my lord the duke and all the court, to quit the fine for one half of his goods I am happy with, so he will let me have the other half in use to render it Upon his death to the
Please, please, what does the fellow say there?
Please, because I never heard it yet, yet I heard too much of Phoebeâ€™s cruelty.
Please, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
Please, please, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Please, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
Please.
Please, please, the Prologue is addressed.
Please, your Lord, accept our duty.
Please, please, that we wake the king?
It is so quick that things get confused.
A wonder father and a wife make this place so rare.
Well done, done.
You are sadder.
So says the Prince and my new-trothÃ¨d lord.
He will waste his money, weary his soldiers, and punish himself while we are still a little tired of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
I will clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other way, to fortuneâ€™s alms.
I will love you, and so, I will pray.
You will feel the loss, but not the friend you weep for.
You will enjoy your hope and marry sweet Bianca with your consent.
You will show me friendship.
She may live without bleeding blood, but I will admit she was not Edwardâ€™s daughter.
So shines a good thing in a naughty world.
If a murderer look dead, so grim.
If he look at it, he will look at things that seem strange.
I should look like the murdered, and I should look like I was beaten by your stern cruelty.
If you are our king, then we will.
He was so smooth that he gave his vice a show of virtue that, despite his apparent open guilt, he lived from all angles of suspects.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth was crowned in Paris, but at nine months old.
He has been so swift that you may imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords want him to have borne his helmet and his sword before him through the city.
Take her to you, shepherd.
Tell them, Publius.
I am abused by my foes, sir, and by my friends.
If we plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, whether it is to have it ster
In these ten thousand they have lost, there are only sixteen hundred mercenaries.
I was able to get to Mantua.
So that, as clear as is the sun, King Pepinâ€™s title and Hugh Capetâ€™s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear to hold in right and title of the female.
If you are not saying that you are two negatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes?
The fool follows after.
The gods keep you and make the hearts of Romans serve your purposes.
The gods will keep you alive.
The life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame.
The maid who stood in the way of my wish will show me the way to my will.
The poor third is up, until death enlarge his confinement.
I should be able to see the sins of my mother.
So the spirit is relaxed.
They are.
They do nothing, it is a venial slip.
You may say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwells near him, or the church stands by your tabor, if your tabor stands by the church.
If you live to see like right bereft, this fool-begged patience in you will be left.
I am so blessed with a thousand times better night.
So to most noble Caesar.
So to them both.
She turns every man the wrong side out and never gives truth and virtue to which simpleness and merit merit are purchased.
I was the one who banished him.
I was when your Highness took his dukedom.
We grew together like a double cherry, a single cherry, a single cherry, and a single cherry, but a single cherry in a split.
You are so blessed with both words.
They were the daggers who were wiped out on their pillows.
You were.
When he opens his purse to give us our reward, your conscience flies out.
Is that white, and a traitor?
I will turn her virtue into a pitch and make the net that will enmeer them all.
It will do with Claudio.
I will, madam, until I lie with you.
You will love me, I am sure.
Do you say when you have seen the sequel?
You will wish to me when the mood is on.
I would not.
You can put a man in your belly.
You will.
You walk softly, look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, especially when I walk away.
So young and so untender?
I am so young, my lord, and true.
So-so is good, very good, very good.
So, adieu.
Again, good night.
Come, help.
Dolabella, it will be the best thing to do.
Good to you.
I am very satisfied.
It will make us mad.
Let me hear you speak.
He furnished me from my own library with volumes that I prize over my dukedom.
So, slave, so on.
So, so, so!
So, so.
Thanks to each other, who we invite to see becrowned at Scone.
This is to horse.
With two seemingly heavenly bodies but one heart, two of the first, like coats in heraldry, due to one and crowned with one crest.
So.
So.
So, you are the most famous: Caesar is not going to consider in what case you stand, more than he is Caesar.
Were you Beatrice?
The night is a sweet one.
Soft, Caesar.
He is soft, does he not?
Here is a short story.
Soft, no grabs.
Soft, sir!
Soft, soft!
Soft!
Soft!
Soft!
You are ready to do so quickly, sir.
I am a little sloppy, my masters.
Sojourn in Mantua.
Sola, sola!
Sola, sola!
Sola!
Soldier, you are a soldier, but his whole action is not in the power of the enemy.
Soldier, why do you wear that glove in your cap?
Soldier, you must come to the king.
Soldiers, have a good watch.
Soldiers, sir.
I was a solitary monarch of the universal earth.
Some people achieve greatnessâ€”â€œWhat do you say?
Some are born great.
Some are born great, others achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon him.
Some blessed power will deliver us from here.
Some bloody passion shakes your frame.
Some comfort, Nurse.
I will be a little bit sucked away.
A dear friend died, and nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man.
Some dungeon.
Five or six and thirty knights, who were chasing him, met him at gate, who are gone with him with some other of his relatives to Dover, where they boast to have well-armed friends.
We had some food and some fresh water that a noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, from his charity, who was appointed Master of this design, gave us, with rich garments, linens, stuffs, and nec
It will give you some friendships that will give you the best chance.
Some gods will direct my judgment.
I have some good things to do, even though I am very good at it.
Some good man bear him carefully from there.
Some grief shows much love, others still show some desire for wit.
I will be a little eile, my lord!
Some innocents are not the thunderbolt.
Some kinds of baseness are undergone.
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolkâ€”Rotcliffe, youself, or Catesby.
Some men there are love not a gaping pig, some are mad if they see a cat, and others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, can't contain their urine.
Some must go off.
Some plants are already ill-rooted.
Some of my shame, if you know of me, how, and why I am, and where I was stained.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
Some officers take them away.
Some oracles must rectify our knowledge.
Some time ago.
Some others search.
Some say the Earth was feverous and did shake.
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
He was a squirt that turned your wit on the seamy side without you and made you suspect me with the Moor.
Some tardy cripple bear the countermand, that came too lag to see him buriÃ¨d.
Some of my friends have a lot of money to pay for
Some of them will always smile through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper, and others will laugh like a parrot, and others will laugh like vinegar, and others will not smile.
Some people kiss.
Some to Decius' house and others to Cascaâ€™s.
Some to Ligarius.
Some people and senators are not affrighted.
Some twenty of them fought in this black conflict, and all those twenty could only kill one life.
Some villain has done me wrong.
Some villains of my court are of consent and suffering in this.
Some wine, ho!
Somebody knocks.
Someone takes order Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.
Something from Cyprus as I can divinely.
Something has you heard of Hamletâ€™s â€œtransformationâ€â€”so call it because neither the exterior nor the inward man resembles that.
He left something that is imperfect in the state, which is thought of since his coming out, and which brings so much fear and danger to the kingdom that his return was the most necessary and necessary.
Something we will determine.
Something, sure, of state, either from Venice, or some unhatched practice made him feel like he was here in Cyprus, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases menâ€™s natures w
I will be a hound, a hog, a bear, a fire.
I am a bit slammed with adders who have cloven tongues that make me mad.
I would divide, and burn in many places.
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtierâ€™s nose, and dreams he would smell a suit.
Sometimes from her eyes I received fair speechless messages.
Son, I will be your half Bianca comes.
Soon at five o'clock, please, I will meet you upon the mart and consort you till bedtime.
I will soon hear and see him.
You have to.
I will help you.
I hear nothing.
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposes hours, makes the night morning, and the night of noontide.
Sorry I am my noble cousin should suspect me that I mean no good to him.
He has three children, and his incensement is so implacable that it can be done by death and sepulchre.
Sound them, it becomes the mouth.
Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me, and rock the ground where they are.
Sound, trumpet!
Good, my lord.
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
I am in such a prison.
Tell me not to say these words like this: â€œSirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundlyâ€?
You are a Caesar?
Tell him you are there?
What is your favorite part of Juliet?
Spare not for the cost.
Reiter.
I am happy.
Speak it again and, even with the word, this hand, which for your love did kill your love, will kill a far more true love.
If you speak love, you will be low.
You will be whipped for taxation one of these days.
Do not speak against it.
Do not speak of Helena.
You are all amazed.
Do not speak.
Reden Sie einmal mehr.
Speak softly.
Speak softly.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I said it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
Speak the word along.
Do not repeat this.
Now, speak to you.
Talk to her, Hamlet.
Talk to him.
Talk to me home.
Tell me what you are doing.
Talk to me.
Talk to us.
Tell what we feel, not what we should say.
Talk within the door.
Speak again.
If you are not, you will have to speak.
Do you think you are so calm?
Talk to your office.
Speak, Agrippa.
You can tell, count, Count, it is your guiding principle.
Speak, hands, for me!
If you are not, I will charge you.
If you say yes, I will go further.
If you can, tell me: What are you?
Isnâ€™t it out of your way?
Speak, man.
Speak, man.
If you speak fair, and fair, I will pray for you.
Speak, nephew.
Speak, Pyramus.
Speak, speak!
Speak, speak.
Speak!
Speak.
Speak.
Speak.
Speak.
Do you mean you in sober meanings?
Do you speak from your heart?
He will be able to do so.
Spend this for me.
Spirit, we must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Spirits, which I have called to act from their confines.
Spit, fire!
Spoke like a tall man who respects your reputation.
Spoke like an officer!
Sport royal, I warrant you.
Sport?
Rain, rain!
Stand aside.
Stand away, Captain Gower.
Stand back.
Stand close and list him.
Stand far off.
Stand fast together, so that some friend of Caesarâ€™s should have a chance to get there.
Stand fast, Titinius.
Stand from the body.
Stand from the hearse.
Stand here, make a good show on â€™t.
Stand not amazed.
Stand still.
Stand you close, then, under this penthouse, for it rains, and I will, like a drunkard, tell you everything.
Stand there!
Stand to it.
Stand up.
Stand you both up now: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
Stand, you are a man.
Stand, ho!

Have a good time with me.
Have my lips the sin they have taken.
He is dead?
He offered it again, then put it back in, but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
He will have no odds.
He is a rogue, and he is a pavin.
You are my gracious sovereign, and you are your peers who are responsible for your lives, your services and your lives.
Have mercy on me.
You will be in Friar Lawrenceâ€™s cell.
How can I say I am alone when all the world is here to look at me?
I beat my tabor, where, like unbacked colts, they shook their ears, advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses as they smelt music.
I will, stars!
I know that my answer must be made.
I will salute you with this royal title: Long live Richard, Englandâ€™s worthy king!
I will come to my mother by and by.
I will give you the creature I serve.
I will kiss your lips, Kate.
You were so honest.
I and you, and all of us, fell down, while bloody treason flourished over us.
I will be brief.
If he loses, he ends up in a swanlike way, fading in music.
If we lose this battle, you are happy to be led in triumph in Rome.
In my tent, Cassius, you will be able to see your griefs and tell you what I will do.
Caesar is the one who will forever knit together.
You can then get a turncoat.
He is more ahold to you than I.
The world is the world.
When earthly things, made even, are together, there is a sigh of relief in heaven.
Keep your vow, sir, when you meet the fellow.
You know that from my soul I love your daughter.
You lead the way, good father
Learn this from me.
Leave her, sir, for you, I tell you all her wealth.
Leave him out.
Let the trumpets sound like a tucket sonance and a note to mount, because our approach will so much be a wrath that England will be afraid and yield.
Let them use us well, and let them know, we are all evils.
Let your love be younger than you, or your affection cannot hold the bent.
Let us be both sudden.
Let your servants bring my husband forth.
Let your will follow their instructions.
I tell you the truth like a Roman.
You love me, Rosalind.
Make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, and let me show you him who made the will.
Come and meet me at the notaryâ€™s.
Move it, while I pray.
Then murder is out of tune, and revenge becomes harsh.
I think you would not have it.
The Jew must be merciful.
You must find new heaven, new earth.
We must look at his age to see how he is treated from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but also the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring
You must speak of one who loved him not wisely, but too well.
Never was man true.
I have no offense.
You will be able to prove a slender panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
Open your lips.
He is a sweet father, for my sake.
I will listen to my impatience.
You know that my dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
Tell her my love story.
I pleaded for you.
Put your pipes in your bag, and I will leave.
He saw you not his face?
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you know in this.
Then say they were not killed.
I will then bleed to death.
I swear to Kate, and you to me, and will be able to give us our oaths to be kept and rewarded.
Then the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, like I said before, that is the strength of their amity will prove the author of their variance.
We will be crammed with news.
Tomorrow we will find that they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
She has some depth?
She is well, and nothing can be ill.
Show it to me.
I slip from her bum, down and cries, and falls into a cough. The whole quire holds their hips and laughs, and waxes in their mirth, and neezes, and
I have heard so much.
Stand with us.
He swore he was a stranger here.
Take him up and manage well the snafu.
Tell me if this is a brother.
Tell me, if I get your daughterâ€™s love, what dowry will I have with her to wife?
Tell me, what makes him feel on the seas?
The liars and swearers are fools, because there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang them up.

If you have seen much and nothing, you have rich eyes and poor hands.
He will go to the woods tomorrow night to pursue her.
Walk us up, even to the marketplace, and waving our red weapons o'er our heads. Letâ€™s all cry, â€œPeace, freedom, and liberty!â€
Let us go.
No more.
If you have too much ear, you can lose your heart or treasure to his unmastered importunity.
Isnâ€™t that a doubt?
I will lay the dagger on your paws.
Then two will woo one.
I would go to Heaven that I never seen.
You will be a fool, a frightened man, and live to be the show and gaze at it.
You are better than the king.
You are mad, if you are no better in your wits than a fool.
You do not love me?
You live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
You have to say, â€œI take you, Rosalind, for wife.â€
You will then bring the chain to her yourself.
You will then buy 'em to sell again.
Your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied and everything about you should be a savage deodorant.
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, and all things are able to be able to make this portion.
You are self-misused.
You will be back, brother.
You are damned for that wicked thing.
If I am not so good, I will not be able to think my poverty is a tad threatening.
Good luck, my lord, teach your cousin to accept winking.
If you acknowledge it, I will make it my dispute.

If he does not, he will stop.
You look at a troublous world.
My queen, in silence, will return to the shade of the night.
They hailed him father to a line of kings.
Tell me, who is the next heir of Naples?
I will answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly, and wisely, I say I am a bachelor.
Then, window, let day in and let life go.
Now, with your will, go on.
You have a pair of chaps, no more, and throw all the food you have, they will grind the one the other.
You conclude, my grandma, he is dead.
I have followed it, or it has drawn me more.

I mean, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
I would have to wear their shoes to get me into more work.
You are like an honorable father.
The more he will blame him.
The tree produces bad fruit.
Young gentlemen, though there was no big matter in the ditty, the note was very untold.

I will come to know you again, King Harry, if you are torn for your ransom, before you will be able to overthrow.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
Turn from me on that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
Turn melancholy to funerals.
Turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all.
Turn you back, and tell your king I do not seek him now, but I could be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment, for to say the sooth, although it is no wisdom to confess
Turn your complexion there, Patience, you are young and rose-lipped cherubin, and look grim as hell.
Turn on your right hand at the next turn, but at the next turn of all on your left.
Turn, hellhound, turn!
Turning your accomplishment of many years into an hour-glass
Fear not, man.
Tush, Gremio.
I can say the fool is the fool.
I will stir up, and all things will be good, I warrant you, wife.
Tush, you are deceived.
Tush, tush, man, never flee and jest at me.
Tut, a toy!
Oh, fear not me.
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know where they do it.
Tut, I have lost myself.
Tut, I have the best armor of the world.
I do not like it.
Tut, she is a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.
You are a man.
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.
Tut, tut, you are all ice
He never liked it.
It was a fault unwillingly.
It was a rough night.
It was a shame no less than his loss, to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing.
It was a sweet marriage, and we prospered well in return.
I was able to get a tooth for two years.
He told him against him, and quit the house on purpose that their punishment might have the better course.
I promise to strike, and you have given me the bitterest terms.
I was the one who killed her.
I was, but not I. I do not shame to tell you what I was, since my conversion was so sweet, being the thing I am.
It was never a merry world, since low feigning was called compliment.
I was not going to need to trow, to give me a trudge.

You will beat the post.
It was flesh that shook those pelican daughters.
I was told you were rough and coy and sullen, and now I find report a very liar.

He was still a little surprised when he could be a tyrant and frustrate his proud will.
We laughed at you.
Isnâ€™t it a sour nose?
Twelve years since Miranda, twelve years since Miranda was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.
Twenty crowns?
Twenty crowns.
Twere as good as drinking when a man is a-hungry, to challenge him to the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.
He is best he can speak no harm to Brutus here.
If you think so, you should be damned.
You do so much for charity.
Who is a queen, fair, sober, wise, would hide from a paddock, from a bat, a gib?
It was too curious to think about it.
He turned his back and said so twice, but kindness, nobler ever than revenge, and nature, stronger than his just occasion, made him fight the lioness, who quickly fell before him
I left him tranced.
Twill is a good way to get to the wrestling world.
It will be a storm.
Twill be heavier by the weight of a man.
Twill be ill taken.

It is a precedent, and many a mistake by the same example will rush into the state.
Twill will bring you gain or perish on the seas.
Twill will endure wind and weather.
He is not seen in him.
Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep disturbers, are they that I would have dealt with.
Two hundred ducats.
Two nights together, these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, were on their watch, in the dead waste and middle of the night, beheaded by a figure like your father, armed at point exactly, cap-Ã 
Two o'clock is your hour?
Two of these two types of words make up four.
Two of my brotherâ€™s men were bound!
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, having some business, do not scream at her to twinkle in their spheres until they return.
Two of them have the very bent of honor, and if they are fooled into believing in it, the practice of it lives in John the Bastard, who is a villain.
Two or three groan.
Two such opposing kings still camp them in man as well as herbsâ€”race and rude will.
Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.
Two things were more important: that for this favor he is now a Christian
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
Two, twoâ€”a shirt and a smock.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishÃ¨d.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banishÃ¨d.
Tybalt would kill you, but you are happy.
Tybalt, my cousin!
Tybalt, that murderer, who ran him?
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, sent a letter to his fatherâ€™s house.
Tybalt, the reason I love you is to excuse the rage to such a greeting.
Tybaltâ€™s death was enough, if it had ended there.
Tyranny is dead!
Tyrant, show your face!
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
Tyrrel, I mean those snagged snagged in the Tower.
Unaccommodated man is no more than a poor, bare, forked animal as you are.
Unarm, Eros.
Unbutton here.
You have dealt with me in a way that is shameful.
Uncle, I must come forth.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, a villain who is hitherto, and who is a villain.
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
Uncle!
If you are in a hurry, why are you now to murder, murder our solemnity?
Uncouple in the western valley.
Let women die under a compelling occasion.
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
Under loveâ€™s heavy burden, I sink.
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Under the earth.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord, because we will hear, note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience sprayed as pure as sin with baptism.
Under what captain do you serve?
Under what title will I woo for you, that God, the law, my honor and her love can make her tender years seem pleasing to her?
You can do it.
I will sell my dukedom to buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm in that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
You are a bad fortune!
I am so happy that I cannot eat my heart in my mouth.
Unkindness may do much, and his unkindness may defeat my life, but never taint my love.
You can't get that threat from your unkind brow and not look at them.

If I have not mista'en his colors much, which I am sure I will not have done, his regiment lies just a half mile south from the mighty power of the king.
If the master was the man, he would not be the man.
If you could not teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
I am not as kind as you are.
I am so sorry for this.
I will not be able to explain the falseness of the truth until I know it.
It is too late to get hurt.
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
To bad causes swear creatures as men doubt.
To the height of fortune, the imperial type of glory this earth has.
I was not willing to accept that.
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
He sat in the air, crowned with the golden sun, savoring his heroical seed and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature and deface the patterns that had been made by God and
So.
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Up with my tent!
Up, my lords.
You are dukes of OrlÃ©ans, Bourbon, and Berri, AlenÃ§on, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy
Up, up, and see the great doomâ€™s image!
Up.
You are more sane, Audrey.
If Publius is not living, who is your sisterâ€™s son, Mark Antony.
When she arrived, Antony sent her to her and invited her to supper.
He is ashamed to sit on his brow, because it is a throne where honor can be crowned.
He does not know how dreadful an army has encircled him, nor does he dedicate one jot of color to the weary and all-watched night.
My brother, my brother, and this grievÃ¨d count did see her, hear her, at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her window.
I heard a humming, and that was a strange one that awakened me.
I was honored to have each actor on his ass.
I am a villain, and I am a villain.
I will do it, my lord.
I find myself a man who is a savage man.
If I have the power to dismiss this court, I will not be able to hear from Bellario, a trained doctor who has sent me to determine this.
I am a lie, a wicked lie.
I am a sword.
My gracious lord.
My Cordelia, upon such sacrifices, the gods themselves throw in incense.
I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
A moon corner is a huge drop.
What was that thing that parted from you?
The King is king!
On the platform, twixt eleven and twelve, I will visit you.
I am right on the right hand.
The stroke of four.
The stroke of four.
At the age of ten.
What is the story of the poisoning?
You are here!
I said that upon this hint.
What bargain do you give me?
What is the cause?
What is the sickness?
After your sword, you will win and you will be able to win.
Urchins will be able to work at night, and all will be able to do so.
If I do not want to do more, I will forget myself.
I do not want to be ashamed or charity.
Urge the necessity and state of times, and be not peeved in great designs.
Use Desdemona well.
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
Use lenity, sweet chuck.
Use me but as your spanielâ€”spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me.
Use me well.
Use them after your own honor and dignity.
Use your authority.
What are my thoughts?
You canâ€™t get a gossipâ€™s bowl, because here we are not.
I will give you the triumph of Caesar.
Varrus and Claudio!
Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!
Vent my fright!
Vent my fright?
Verona, for a while, I take my leave to see my friends in Padua, but of all my best belovÃ¨d and approvÃ¨d friend, Hortensio.
Veronaâ€™s summer has not been a flower.
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense.
Very easy to use.
Very bad.
Very happy.
If they are out, they will spit

Very good!
Very good.
Very sick.

Very well.
Very well.
Very well.

Very well.
Vex is not his ghost.
Vex is not his prescience.
Victory sits on our helms.
Vile earth, to earth resign.
I am none.
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate and rap me well, or I will knock your knaveâ€™s pate.
Villain, not for your life.
Villain, you denied the goldâ€™s receipt and told me of a mistress and a dinner, for which, I hope, you felt displeased.
Villain, you know neither the law of God nor man.
You are a man, you are a man, for even her words did you deliver to me on the mart.
You are a vile man!
You did not, when your vile daggers shook the sides of Caesar.
Virtue is beauty, but the evil evil is empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, and vice sometime by action dignified.
Virtue that transgresses is only patched with sin, and sin that amends is only patched with virtue.
Virtue?
I pray to those who have not read the story that I can prompt them to write it.
Wear this ring.
I am not going to curse your self by circumstance.
I am a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a
Wake Duncan with your knocking.
Wake her up.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Warm, o' my troth.
Warrant you, my man is as true as steel.
Was not the way?
Wasnâ€™t it to this end that you began to twist a story so fine?
Was he saved you?
Was you so oft threatening to kill him?
Was ever a book with such vile matter so bound?
Was ever man so 'rayed'?
Was ever man so beaten?
Was ever man so weary?
Was ever a match clapped up so suddenly?
Was ever woman in this humor won?
Was ever woman in this humor wooed?
Was he not born of woman?
Was he not a companion to the riotous knights that tend upon my father?
Was he not here?
Was I with you there for the goose?
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
Was it so late, friend, you went to bed, that you lie so late?
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue should become kings of Naples?
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
Was never mother so dear a loss?
Was never widow so dear a loss?
Wasnâ€™t Charles, the dukeâ€™s wrestler, here to speak with me?
Wasnâ€™t John here at supper?
Wasnâ€™t Cassio apart from my wife?
Was that letter from fair Jessica?
Was not this love really?
Was that done like Cassius?
Was that mine?
Was that my father who went so fast?
Was the crown offered him three times?
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself?
Was this ambition?
Was this before the king returned?
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, made to write â€œwhoreâ€?
Wash them his wounds with tears?
Wash your hands.
Wasn't I born here?
Wasnâ€™t you ever in court, shepherd?
Wasnâ€™t you mad, that you have so madly answered me?
Wasnâ€™t you not charged at riskâ€”fore to Dover?â€”Let him answer that first.
Watch me like Argus.
Watch you tonight for the command, I will not lay on you.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, and in the spirit of men there is no blood.
We are all arrant knaves.
We are blessed with the change.
We are the only one who is riddled of Rome.
We are bound to the same.
We are enough to smother the English in our throngs, if any order is thought upon.
We are for you.
We are friends.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
We are haunted.
We are in Godâ€™s hand, brother, and not in theirs.
We are men, my liege.
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, to whom our passion is as subjected as our wretches are engulfed in our prisons.
We are resolved, my lord.
We are sent to give you a thank you from our royal master, only to show you his sight, and not pay you.
We are spoiled and yondering.
We are so much like dreams, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-out faults, as I will do your best to keep your country nice in giving me a kiss.
We are the queenâ€™s abjects and must obey. Brother, farewell.
We are their parents and are original.
We are three of them.
We are two lions littered in one day, and I am the elder and more terrible.
We are gone, lady, we are gone.
We are sorry for it.
We are yet to be young in doing so.
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant that we be admitted where he is.
We are strangers here, how do you trust a charge so big from your own custody?
We both have fed, and we can both Endure the cold winter as well as he.
We came to cry.
We came to fight with you.
We cannot be masters, nor can all masters be followed.
We cannot be here and there too.
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears.
We cannot fight for love as men may.
We charge you, in the Princeâ€™s name, a fee!
We do not have augurity.
We kept time in our catchments, sir.
We sat down and commented on the savage deer.
We do not come as minding as we do to contest you, we have the true intent.
We do not know.
We do not mean the snatchers, but we fear the Scot, who has been a giddy neighbor to us.
We do, my lord.
We do not doubt it.
We doubt that it is not the case now, but every rub is smoothed on our way.
We doubt not a fair and lucky war, since God has brought this dangerous treason to light.
We will first speak to you, who rivaled with this king Hath for our daughter.
We follow you.
We found him in the churchyard.
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.
We had a much more monstrous feast, which merited noting.
We have a foolish banquet towards us.
We have beat him to his camp.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, which is the speedier we hope, the better for our words.
We have been up and down to seek him.
We have reason to be glad that matters are so well digested.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
We have done our job.
We have been too far.
Here we have recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery ever known in the commonwealth.
We have kissed Kingdoms and provinces.
We have lost the best half of our affair.
We have lost your son forever, I fear.
We have no friend but resolution, and the shortest end.
We have none of that, sir.
We have not made good preparations.
We have not spoken about torchbearers.
We have yet to set this day of triumph.
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
We have seen the best of our time.
We have to do it, and they have earned the waste.
We have already sworn, my lord.
We have two hours to furnish.
We have used our throats in Egypt.
We have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot.
We have willing dames enough.
We have, sir.
We are here to assist you.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
We judge no less.
We know each otherâ€™s faces
We know your charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
We know what belongs to a watch.
We learn only the confident tyrant who keeps in Dunsinane and will endure our setting before we leave.
We look for you tomorrow.
We did not look for Mark Antony here.
We love him very much and will continue our graces towards him.
We may as bootless spend our vain command on your enragÃ¨d soldiers in their spoils as we send precepts to the Leviathan to come ashore.
We may have a good day.
We must be married, or we must live in a secluded place.
We must be patient, but I cannot choose to be patient, to think they should lay him a cold ground.
We must bear everything.
We must give and take, my loving lord.
We must die, Messala.
We must do something, and i' m a heat.
We must follow the leaders.
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird has done to her own nest.
We must be inclining towards the king.
He is now in awe of his remorse.
We do not.
We must obey the time.
We must go out and talk.
We must be hungry from the food of lovers until midnight.
We must watch.
We never valued this poor place of England and therefore, living in this country, we gave ourselves a bribe license, as it is common that men are the merriest when they are from home.
We are near his cell.
We will not be happy with them by land.
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
We say that Shoreâ€™s wife has a pretty foot, a cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue, and that the queenâ€™s kindred are made gentlefolks.
We say the king is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them.
We see it and will say it.
We see the beginning of the day, but I think we will never see the end of it.
We will be very unfurnished for this time.
We will be the more marketable.
If I stay longer, we will be fine.
We will find a time, Audrey.
We will find him a shrewd contriver.
We will think on it further.
We will have a rare letter from him: but you wonâ€™t deliver?
We will know by this fellow.
We will ne'er be younger.
We will obey, if she was ten times our mother.
I will.
We will do what you command us.
We will, my lord.
We would have had your good advice, which has been both grave and prosperous, in this dayâ€™s council, but we will take it tomorrow.
We would have met you on sea and land, supplying every stage with a augmented greeting.
We should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and give her a rest to her as to peace-parted souls.
We are not a treason, man.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites: If we do not obey them, this will happen: They will suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
We thank you for your honor.
We have a great cause of thankfulness and will forget the office of our hand sooner than the abandonment of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness.
We think it is not so, my lord.
We are three, but you are two.
We took him for a cowardly look, but he is the very devil incardinate.
We took this mattock and he sat there as he came from this churchyardâ€™s side.
We will sing like birds in my cage.
We will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety.
We wait upon your Grace.
We wait upon your Grace.
We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.
We were Christians eno' before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.
We will be married on Sunday.
We will be happy!
We will be witnesses.
We will behold his death.
We will go together.
We will walk a little in the orchard, then to dinner.
We will greet you.
We will be eilen.
We will have more of this tomorrow.
We will not have any telling.
We will have a prologue, and it will be written in eight and six.
We will hear Caesarâ€™s will.
We will then feast and sport us at your fatherâ€™s house.
We will here.
We will meet, and there we will be able to hear most obscenely and courageously.
We will not fail.
We will provide you with.
He will be better off going to church if he does.
We will not proceed further in this business.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.
We will speak further.
We will do well.
We will, fair queen, climb up to the top of the mountain, and mark the confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction.
We will, my noble lord.
We will.
We wish you peace.
Before we hear him, we would be able to do some things of weight that we have to do with France.
We would have all of those offenders so cut off, and we give express charge that in our marchs through the country there is nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided
We would not die in that manâ€™s company, who fears his fellowship will die with us.
We would do so, and then go a-batfowling.
We are at the height of this crisis.
We, Hermia, have created two flowers with our needles, two on one sampler, one on one cushion, and two on one song, both in one key.
We, ignorant of ourselves, are often able to deal with our own harms, which the wise powers refuse to do for our good, and find we can profit by losing our prayers.
We will meet them at Philippi.
We will answer.
We will be away tonight, and we will be a day before our husbands home.
We will be friends first.
We will beat â€™em into bench-holes.
We will bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
We will burn his body in the holy place, and with the brands fire the houses of the kings.

We will bury him, and then, what is brave, what is noble, letâ€™s do a little less after the Roman style and make death proud to take us.
We will cut the signior.
We will all be together.
We will feast each other ere we are, and letâ€™s draw lots of people who will start.
We will give them a present audience.
We will go together, and if you have your youthful wages spent, we will light up some settled low content.
We will go to supper i' th morning.
Tomorrow night we will not be able to do anything.
We will have you to a couch softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.
We will have you, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, â€œHere may you see the tyrant.â€ I will not yield, to kiss the ground before Malcolm
Tomorrow we will hear a play.
We will hear him what he says.
We will hear him.
We will hear it, Antony.
We will hear the will.

We will know all our fortunes.
We will lead you through the process.
We will leave you, Brutus.
We will be preparing our dinner here.
We will mutiny.
We will not meet again, we will not see one another.
We will not run, Monsieur Monster.

We will revenge his death.
We will see 'em hunger first.
We will see our husbands before they think of us.
We will send Mark Antony to the senate house, and he will say you are not well today.
We will teach you that there is no laboring in the winter.
We will begin with these rites, as we trust they will end, in delights.
We will speak to them tonight, and I will force the wine to scream through their scars.

We will visit Caliban, my slave who never gives us a kind answer.
We will wait on your lordship.
We will wait on your lordship.
We will whisper a couple of sage saws.
Weapons, arms?
Wear both of them, because both of them are thin.
He will swindle, peak and pine.
Wednesday is tomorrow.
Weeping and wailing over Tybaltâ€™s corse.
You do not have to be a sanctuary in taking him.

Well aimed at a young man.
You are welcome to the open air.
Be with you, gentlemen.

Have you heard something hard of hearing?
I am a good man.
I know the man.
You will prosper.
Well, you will be happy with your speed.
Good to meet here.

Well said.
Well said.
Well, moon!
Well struck!
Now, confess and live.
Well, go you into hell?
Well, I know you.
If I ever thank any man, I will thank you.
Now, it appears you need my help.
Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
Well, then, no more than that: go, gentle Catesby, and, as it was far away, sound your Lord Hastings how he is affected by our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the Tower to sit about the
Have you taken into account my speeches?
Well, then, sustain me.
Take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
Well, the peace you had so far urged Lies to give him.
Signor Benedick said so.
Well thought on.
Well thought on.
Well too.
You were so good today, sir.
Well, it is not so, my Lord High Constable.
Well, again.
Well, it is all one.
Well, it is all about that.
Well, I am like to do, because I see, four feasts are toward them.
Well, as time will try.
Well, you guess?
I will turn, and something to cut it off of a quick hand.
Well, be it.
Well, Brutus, you are noble.
Well, but to my choice.
Well, what is o'clock?
If I get older for a few days, I will send some packing that you think isnâ€™t going to.
Come back tomorrow.
Come, my Kate.
Well, daughter, and you ladies, you are all going to be masked.
Do it, and be brief.
Do your discretion.
Well, you are good, my lord.
If you do your favor, sir, why not give God thanks and make no boasts of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need for such vanity.
Well, forward, forward.
Well, gentlemen, I am so resolved: On Sunday next, you know my daughter Katherina is to be married.
Get you out.
Well, girl, you are not so much for his death as the villain lives who slaughtered him.
Go your way.

Go to, I will.

I am not fair, and I pray the gods make me honest.
I am sorry for your niece.
Well, I can tell you.
Well, I think.

I know not what counts harsh Fortune casts on my face, but she will never come to my heart to make my heart her vassal.
Well, I say no.
I will be a sinner, to be a double-dealer.
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think has legs.
I will do it, though I take you in the company of the king.

Well, I will be revenged as I can.
Well, I will break in.
I will end the song.
I will hide the body in some hole until the duke gives order for his burial.

Well, in that case, you miss it.
Well, Jessica, go in.
Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
Juliet, I will lie with you tonight.
Keep me company, but two years later, you will not know the sound of your own tongue.
Let him go.
Let it be.

Well, you may see things done here.
Well, more anon.
Well, my dreadful lordâ€”so must I call you now.
Hey, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Well, my good lord, I have informed them of that.

Well, sir, I thank you.
Well, sir, I will.
Well, sir, I will bring you to our master Lear and leave you to attend him.
Well, sir, in short, the gown is not for me.

Oh, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Well, sir, then it will be dry.
Well, sir, we will not.
Well, sir?
Well, sir.
Well, sir.
Let us hear Barnardo speak about this.
Oh, stand aside.
Susan is with God.
Well, Syracusian, tell you in brief the cause why you are going to be from your native home and for what reason you came to Ephesus.
Tell me now what lady you are the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, that you promised to tell me about today.
That is the dowry of his wife, and he is not getting any of his own money.
Well, the beginning is dead and buried.
Well, then I will see you again.

You do best.
You have comforted me so much.
Time is the old justice that examines all offenders and lets time try.

Put your sword on the ground.
Well, you have a careful father, child.
Well, we will prosper now.
Well, well, well.
Well, well.
What is it?
What was yours?
What is the worst?
You are a rare parrot-teacher.
You are gone both ways.
You are going to call all the alehouses and bid those who are drunk to get them to bed.
You have made a simple choice.
You may be afraid to go too far.
You temporize with the hours.
Well, your imprisonment will not be long.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Well.

If never orphans had a loss of so much value.
Isnâ€™t my doors locked up and I am shutting out?
Did you not have you even now with the Countess Olivia?
Were so things here as we speak?
If the world was mine, Demetrius being bated, the rest I would give to you to be translated.
If they were not forced with those that should be ours, we would have met them humbling, beard to beard, and beat them backwards.
If we were in front of our armies, I would do so.

If you were a woman, as the rest goes, I would have my tears fall upon your cheek and say â€œThrice-welcome, drowned Viola!â€ My father had a mole on his brow.
Did you know when it began?
Have you been the messenger?
If you were well served, you would be taught your duty.
You are as young as I, Juliet, you are as young as I, Juliet, you are married, Tybalt murdered, doing like me, and like me banishÃ¨d, then you may speak,

You, sir?
You, uncivil lady, have poured out my ingrate and unauspicious altars, and I will do it.
You, you, you, ay, you!
You, you, sirrah, where is my daughter?
