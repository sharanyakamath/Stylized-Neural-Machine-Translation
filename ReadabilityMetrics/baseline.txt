I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest. ’ 
Give him this letter. 
Adieu!Farewell!” 
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. 
But adieu. Farewell.Adieu to you.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
Adieu. Farewell.
Farewell, good Launcelot. 
O, how vile a sin it is in my heart To shame my mother to bear me the name of her father!
But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners.
If thou hold’st promise of it, let me end the strife; Become thou Christian, and thine own wife, For this is the cause of this quarrel.”
